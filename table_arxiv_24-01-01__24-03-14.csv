Cutting a Wire with Non-Maximally Entangled States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09690v1,"Marvin Bechtold, Johanna Barzen, Frank Leymann, Alexander Mandl","Distributed quantum computing supports combining the computational power of multiple quantum devices to overcome the limitations of individual devices. Circuit cutting techniques enable the distribution of quantum computations through classical communication. These techniques involve partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits, each containing fewer qubits. The original circuit's outcome can be replicated by executing these subcircuits on separate devices and combining their results. However, the number of shots required to achieve a fixed result accuracy with circuit cutting grows exponentially with the number of cuts, posing significant costs. In contrast, quantum teleportation allows the distribution of quantum computations without an exponential increase in shots. Nevertheless, each teleportation requires a pre-shared pair of maximally entangled qubits for transmitting a quantum state, and non-maximally entangled qubits cannot be used for this purpose. To address this, this work investigates the potential of utilizing non-maximally entangled qubit pairs in wire cutting, a specific form of circuit cutting, to mitigate the associated costs. The cost of this cutting procedure reduces with the increasing degree of entanglement in the pre-shared qubit pairs. We derive the optimal sampling overhead in this context and present a wire cutting technique employing pure non-maximally entangled states that achieves this optimal sampling overhead. Hence, this offers a continuum between existing wire cutting and quantum teleportation.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Štrobl, O. Erece, F. Olivares, M. Morell","Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, we applied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe DarkLensCode, an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $t_\mathrm{E}=316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $t_\mathrm{E}=299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $M_L = 5.6^{+7.5}_{-2.5} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.05^{+0.78}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$ or $M_L = 12.0^{+14.9}_{-5.4} M_\odot$ located at $D_S = 1.18^{+0.82}_{-0.63}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.",{'black holes': 3},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

The primary aim of this work is to elucidate the influence of quantum gravitational effects on thermodynamic behaviors, critical phenomena, phase transitions, and the stability of black holes. We observe that charged AdS black holes exhibit thermodynamic behavior similar to that of Van der Waals fluids when influenced by quantum gravity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel black hole thermodynamic phenomenon, which we term ``resistance of phase transitions"".

Black hole thermodynamics in generalized Proca theories,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08986v1,"Masato Minamitsuji, Kei-ichi Maeda","We investigate thermodynamics of static and spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) in generalized Proca (GP) theories by applying the Iyer-Wald prescription. BH solutions in GP theories are divided into the two classes. The first class corresponds to the solutions obtained by the direct promotion of the BH solutions in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, while the second class consists of the solutions which are obtained only in GP theories and contain a nonzero electromagnetic field. For BH solutions in the first class, we confirm that the BH entropy and its thermodynamic mass remain the same as those in the counterpart solution in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. We also calculate the thermodynamical variables of the several static and spherically-symmetric BH solutions in the second class, and investigate the thermodynamical stability when there exist two BH solutions.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Generic spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes with equilibrium throat at the innermost photonsphere are unstable,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08932v1,S. Habib Mazharimousavi,"In this research, we prove analytically that a generic spherically symmetric thin-shell wormhole (TSW) with its throat located at the innermost photonsphere of the bulk asymptotically flat black hole and supported by a generic surface barotropic perfect fluid is unstable against a radial linear perturbation. This is the generalization of the instability of the Schwarzschild TSW (STSW) with the throat's radius located at $a_{0}=3M$ that was revealed by Poisson and Visser in their seminal work \cite{Poisson1995} where they studied the mechanical stability of STSW. Our proof provides a link between the instability of the null circular geodesics on the innermost photonsphere of a generic static spherically symmetric asymptotically black hole and the TSW constructed in the same bulk with $a_{0}=r_{c}$ where $% a_{0} $ and $r_{c}$ are the radius of the TSW and the innermost photonsphere, respectively. For asymptotically flat spherically symmetric black holes possessing more than one photonspheres, the number of the photonspheres is odd and at least one photonsphere is stable which implies the corresponding TSW with its throat identical with the stable photonsphere is also stable.","{'black holes': 1, 'geodesics': 1}",03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Partitioned Quantum Subspace Expansion,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08868v1,"Tom O'Leary, Lewis W. Anderson, Dieter Jaksch, Martin Kiffner",We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated beyond the current state of the art.,{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
The Present-Day Mass Function of Star Clusters in the Solar Neighborhood,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08850v1,"Xiaoying Pang, Siqi Liao, Jiadong Li, Zhiqiang Yan, Mingjie Jian, M. B. N. Kouwenhoven, Shih-Yun Tang, Yifan Wang","This work analyses the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93~star clusters utilizing Gaia DR3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $α$, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of $α$ for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$, exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with $α$, as $α$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of $α$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between $α$ and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Doppler holography for ophthalmology,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08849v1,Michael Atlan,"A comprehensive assessment of retinal health demands reliable and precise methods to measure localized blood perfusion. Despite considerable advancements in imaging techniques, such as indocyanine green and fluorescein angiography, along with optical coherence tomography angiography, their capacity to monitor blood flow dynamics across the cardiac cycle faces significant limitations. For more effective care of those with ocular conditions, innovating new approaches is paramount. Doppler holography, an emerging non-invasive optical imaging technique, meets this challenge by offering high temporal resolution imaging of retinal and choroidal blood flow. Now a burgeoning interdisciplinary research field, Doppler holography intertwines functional optical imaging system design, high-performance computing, and clinical investigation. Through collaborative efforts among universities, industry partners, and ophthalmic clinics, a network for its advancement and application is taking shape. This endeavor promises to propel the discovery of novel functional biomarkers, transforming the diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases, refining disease severity categorization, and enhancing therapeutic monitoring-ultimately leading to improved healthcare outcomes.",{'holography': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']
Efficient and practical Hamiltonian simulation from time-dependent product formulas,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08729v1,"Jan Lukas Bosse, Andrew M. Childs, Charles Derby, Filippo Maria Gambetta, Ashley Montanaro, Raul A. Santos","In this work we propose an approach for implementing time-evolution of a quantum system using product formulas. The quantum algorithms we develop have provably better scaling (in terms of gate complexity and circuit depth) than a naive application of well-known Trotter formulas, for systems where the evolution is determined by a Hamiltonian with different energy scales (i.e., one part is ""large"" and another part is ""small""). Our algorithms generate a decomposition of the evolution operator into a product of simple unitaries that are directly implementable on a quantum computer. Although the theoretical scaling is suboptimal compared with state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., quantum signal processing), the performance of the algorithms we propose is highly competitive in practice. We illustrate this via extensive numerical simulations for several models. For instance, in the strong-field regime of the 1D transverse-field Ising model, our algorithms achieve an improvement of one order of magnitude in both the system size and evolution time that can be simulated with a fixed budget of 1000 arbitrary 2-qubit gates, compared with standard Trotter formulas.",{'quantum computer': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We explicitly prove how to update our formalism with Clifford gates, non-Clifford gates, and measurements, enabling universal circuit simulation. We also discuss how the framework allows for efficient simulation of more states, raising some interesting questions on the representation power of tensor networks and the quantum properties of resources such as entanglement and magic, and support our claims with simulations.",{'tensor networks': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Tensor Networks']

Wittek, Nils L. Vu, Kyle C. Nelli, Alexander Carpenter, Geoffrey Lovelace, Mark A. Scheel, William Throwe","One of the most promising avenues to perform numerical evolutions in theories beyond General Relativity is the fixing-the-equations approach, a proposal in which new ``driver'' equations are added to the evolution equations in a way that allows for stable numerical evolutions. In this direction, we extend the numerical relativity code SpECTRE to evolve a ``fixed'' version of scalar Gauss-Bonnet theory in the decoupling limit, a phenomenologically interesting theory that allows for hairy black hole solutions in vacuum. We focus on isolated black hole systems both with and without linear and angular momentum, and propose a new driver equation to improve the recovery of such stationary solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the latter by numerically evolving black holes that undergo spontaneous scalarization using different driver equations.

Effect of Earth&#39;s Oblateness on Black Hole Imaging Through Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08606v1,"Aditya Tamar, Ben Hudson, Daniel Palumbo","Earth-based Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has made rapid advances in imaging black holes. However, due to the limitations imposed on terrestrial VLBI by the Earth's finite size and turbulent atmosphere, it is imperative to have a space-based component in future VLBI missions. Herein, this paper investigates the effect of Earth's oblateness, also known as the $J_{2}$ effect, on orbiters in Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI. The paper provides an extensive discussion on how the $J_{2}$ effect can directly impact orbit selection for black hole observations and how through informed choices of orbital parameters, the effect can be used to the mission's advantage, a fact that has not been addressed in existing space-VLBI investigations. We provide a comprehensive study of how the orbital parameters of several current space VLBI proposals will vary specifically due to the $J_{2}$ effect. For black hole accretion flow targets of interest, we have demonstrated how the $J_{2}$ effect leads to modest increase in shorter baseline coverage, filling gaps in the $(u,v)$ plane. Subsequently, we construct a simple analytical formalism that allows isolation of the impact of the $J_{2}$ effect on the $(u,v)$ plane without requiring computationally intensive orbit propagation simulations. By directly constructing $(u,v)$ coverage using the $J_{2}$ affected and invariant equations of motion, we obtain distinct coverage patterns for M87* and SgrA* that show extremely dense coverage on short baselines as well as long term orbital stability on longer baselines.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08459v1,"Shuo Liu, Hao-Kai Zhang, Shuai Yin, Shi-Xin Zhang","Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1) symmetric circuits for certain small symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively.

We present a simplified equivalent formalism for identifying stabilizer ground states of general Pauli Hamiltonians. Moreover, we also develop an exact and linear-scaled algorithm to obtain stabilizer ground states of 1D local Hamiltonians and thus free from discrete optimization. This proposed theoretical formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on different Hamiltonians.

Observational tests in scale invariance II: gravitational lensing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08379v1,"Andre Maeder, Frederic Courbin","We study the path of light rays passing near a massive object, in the context of the scale invariant equation of the geodesics first obtained by Dirac (1973). Using the exterior Schwarzschild solution for the metric, we derive the complete equations of the geodesics in the scale invariant context. We find that scale invariance introduces two additional terms to the Einstein term producing the deflection angle and that can potentially act over cosmological distances. Numerical integration of the scale-invariant geodesics, for the specific case of the z_L=1.94 lens galaxy in the extreme system JWST-ER1 (van Dokkum et al. 2023) shows that the two additional terms introduce only negligible effects, typically 1E-06 of the Einstein term. We conclude that the lensing deflection angle derived in Einstein's General Relativity is essentially independent of the scale invariant effects and that the photon's geodesics remain unchanged. We also explore the possible origin of the differences in the mass estimates from lensing and photometry in JWST-ER1 and in the SLACS galaxies, differences which appear larger at higher redshifts.",{'geodesics': 4},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Generalized free energy and thermodynamic phases of black holes in the gauged Kaluza-Klein theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08322v1,"Tran N. Hung, Cao H.

The black hole solutions are asymptotic to the AdS$_D$ geometry and can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the gauged supergravities on the compact internal manifolds, leading to the restriction as $4\leq D\leq 7$. By studying the behavior of the generalized free energy under the change of the ensemble temperature, we determine the thermodynamic phases and the corresponding phase transitions of black holes. This is confirmed by investigating the heat capacity at the constant pressure and the on-shell free energy. In the canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes can be classified into three different classes as follows: (i) $D=4$, (ii) $D=5$, and (iii) $D=6,7$. Whereas, in the grand canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes is independent of the number of spacetime dimensions and the pressure, but depends on the chemical potential $Φ$.

Galaxy mergers may be an important route to fuel and to produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs can be observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to systematically search for such dual quasars at previously unreachable sub-kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. Here we present the first detailed study of a 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation, VODKA-selected dual quasar, J0749+2255, at $z=2.17$ using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. This is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars identified today. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, best traced by the narrow \ha\ emission. Line ratio diagnostics show a mix of ionization from the two quasars and intense star formation. The spatially-resolved spectra of the two quasars suggest that they have very similar black hole properties (two $M_{BH}\sim 10^9\ \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ with large Eddington ratio reaching $L/L_{Edd}\sim0.2$) hinting at the possible synchronized growth and accretion from the same gas supply. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest an extended, rotating disk rather than a disturbed system that would be expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. While it is unclear if J0749+2255 is representative of the dual quasar evolution, the observations with JWST revealed a major puzzle.

For this, we first translate quantum information concepts such as entanglement and correlation into the context of quantum chemical systems. In particular, we establish two conceptually distinct perspectives on `electron correlation' leading to a notion of orbital and particle correlation. We then demonstrate that particle correlation equals total orbital correlation minimized over all orbital bases. Accordingly, particle correlation resembles the minimal, thus intrinsic, complexity of many-electron wave functions while orbital correlation quantifies their complexity relative to a basis. We illustrate these concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic correlation complexity in molecular systems, which also manifests the crucial link between the two correlation pictures.

51% Attack via Difficulty Increase with a Small Quantum Miner,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08023v1,"Bolton Bailey, Or Sattath","We present a strategy for a single quantum miner with relatively low hashing power, with the same ramifications as a 51% attack. Bitcoin nodes consider the chain with the highest cumulative proof-of-work to be the valid chain. A quantum miner can manipulate the block timestamps to multiply the difficulty by $c$. The fork-choice rule counts every block with increased difficulty with weight $c$. By using Grover's algorithm, it is only $O(\sqrt c)$ harder for the quantum miner to mine such blocks. By picking a high enough $c$, the single quantum miner can create a competing chain with fewer blocks, but more cumulative proof-of-work. The time required is $O(\frac{1}{r^2})$ epochs, where $r$ is the fraction of the block rewards that the quantum miner would have received if they mined honestly.

TriOS Schwarzschild Orbit Modeling: Robustness of Parameter Inference for Masses and Shapes of Triaxial Galaxies with Supermassive Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07996v1,"Jacob Pilawa, Emily R.

However, there have been only a handful of studies using simulated data to examine the ability of this method to reliably recover known input black hole masses $M_{BH}$ and other galaxy parameters. Here we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the triaxial Schwarzschild method at $\textit{simultaneously}$ determining $M_{BH}$, stellar mass-to-light ratio $M^{*}/L$, dark matter mass, and three intrinsic triaxial shape parameters of simulated galaxies. For each of 25 rounds of mock observations using simulated stellar kinematics and the $\texttt{TriOS}$ code, we derive best-fitting parameters and confidence intervals after a full search in the 6D parameter space with our likelihood-based model inference scheme. The two key mass parameters, $M_{BH}$ and $M^{*}/L$, are recovered within the 68% confidence interval, and other parameters are recovered between 68% and 95% confidence intervals. The spatially varying velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits is also well recovered. We explore whether the goodness-of-fit measure used for galaxy model selection in our pipeline is biased by variable complexity across the 6D parameter space.

In this work, we explore the use of dynamical decoupling (DD) in characterizing undesired two-qubit couplings as well as the underlying single-qubit decoherence, and in suppressing them. We develop a syncopated dynamical decoupling technique which protects against decoherence and selectively targets unwanted two-qubit interactions, overcoming both significant hurdles to achieving precise quantum control and realizing quantum computing on many hardware prototypes. On a transmon-qubit-based superconducting quantum device, we identify separate white and $1/f$ noise components underlying the single-qubit decoherence and a static ZZ coupling between pairs of qubits.

An observational signature of this phenomenon is the detection of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) amongst merging systems, as predicted by cosmological models of structure formation. Dual AGNs at sub-kiloparsec-scale separation are the precursors of merging black hole binaries, an important source of gravitational waves, but a paucity of such systems have been confirmed to date by direct imaging, while other similar claims have been strongly disputed. Here we report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a dual black hole system with a separation of ~100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z=0.016). Chandra/ACIS imaging shows two spatially-resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Ka emission line, consistent with a dual SMBH, which is supported by Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Very Large Array (VLA) observations.

Using Equation of State Constraints to Classify Low-Mass Compact Binary Mergers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07697v1,"Jacob Golomb, Isaac Legred, Katerina Chatziioannou, Adrian Abac, Tim Dietrich","Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

It has passed many experimental tests in the Solar System as well as binary pulsar, cosmological and gravitational-wave (GW) observations. Some of these tests probe regimes where gravitational fields are weak, the spacetime curvature is small, and the characteristic velocities are not comparable to the speed of light. Observations of compact binary coalescences enable us to test GR in extreme environments of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, large spacetime curvature, and velocities comparable to the speed of light. Since the breakthrough observation of the first GW signal produced by the merger of two black holes, GW150914, in September 2015, the number of confirmed detections of binary mergers has rapidly increased to nearly 100. The analysis of these events has already placed significant constraints on possible deviations from GR and on the nature of the coalescing compact objects. In this chapter, we discuss a selection of tests of GR applicable to observations of GWs from compact binaries.

Bilocal holography and locality in the bulk,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07606v1,"Robert de Mello Koch, Garreth Kemp, Hendrik J. R. Van Zyl",Bilocal holography provides a constructive approach to the vector model/higher spin gravity duality. It has two ingredients: a change of field variables and a change of space time coordinates. The change of field variables ensures that the loop expansion parameter becomes ${1\over N}$. The change of coordinates solves the Clebsch-Gordan problem of moving from the tensor product basis (in which the collective bilocal field is written) to the direct sum basis (appropriate for the description of the gravity fields). We argue that the change of space time coordinates can be deduced by requiring that operators constructed in the bilocal collective field theory are dual to local operators in the AdS bulk.,{'holography': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']

We investigate this iterative process, wherein new degrees of freedom are created and entangled with the previous ones through local symmetries. We focus on gauging spin chains with Abelian group symmetries and arranging the new spins on a 2D lattice. The local symmetries of the emergent 2D state, which are modified by the concatenation of the following gauging maps surprisingly correspond to the stabilizer terms of the $XZZX$-code generalized to any Abelian group. We encode our construction in the family of tensor network states that we dub ``projected entangled pair emergent states'' (PEPES).

By transforming the metric into Fefferman-Graham form, we have calculated the energy of the conformal fluid at the boundary.

By employing the definition of OTOC in quantum mechanics, we derive the formulas and demonstrate explicitly the numerical calculations of the OTOC. Our calculation illustrates the quantum OTOC with imaginary Lyapunov coefficient indicates the possibly metastable baryonic status in the presence of the theta angle while the classical OTOC can not, thus it reveals the theta-dependent features of QCD are dominated basically by its quantum properties.

From the data, we calculated the supermassive black hole masses using broad emission from the magnesium II and hydrogen beta lines. We compared this with the stellar mass of the entire galaxy and find that the black holes are significantly more massive than would be predicted by local relations, indicating that the majority of black hole growth precedes the bulk of the the stellar mass formation. In addition to this, we created a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy to calculate the star formation rate.

For $Q=2$, the spectrum of such states is known to be universal and properly captured by the long-distance limit of holographic theories, regardless of whether the CFT itself is holographic. We study in detail the holographic description of such states at $Q>2$, by considering the contribution to the energies of $Q$ scalar particles coming from single photon and graviton exchange in the bulk of AdS; in some cases, scalar exchange and bulk contact terms are also included. For a range of finite values of $Q$ and $J$, we numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian for such states and examine the resulting spectrum and wavefunctions as a function of the dimension $Δ$ of the charge-one operator and the central charges $c_{\mathcal{T}}, c_{\mathcal{J}}$ of the stress tensor and U(1) current, finding multiple regions in parameter space with qualitatively different behavior.

In this work, we critically review observational evidence for the preferential activation of SMBHs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We develop a semi-empirical model under the assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. We demonstrate that the model is broadly consistent with recent observations on the AGN halo occupation at $z=0.2$, although it may overpredict satellite AGN in massive halos at that low redshift. We then use this model to interpret the projected radial distribution of X-ray sources around high redshift ($z\approx1$) massive ($>5 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) clusters, which show excess counts outside their virial radius. Such an excess naturally arises in our model as a result of sample variance. Up to 20% of the simulated projected radial distributions show excess counts similar to the observations, which are however, because of background/foreground AGN and hence, not physically associated with the cluster.

To assess the impact of model-specific parameter dependencies, we present a case study of the nearby heavily obscured low-luminosity AGN NGC 3982, which has a variety of column density estimations reported in the literature. We fit the same broadband XMM-Newton + NuSTAR spectra of the source with five unique obscuration models and generate posterior parameter distributions for each.

While the first type of modes, which are arbitrarily long-lived, are recognized in various four-dimensional backgrounds as quasi-resonances, the second type is a novel feature for asymptotically flat black holes.

Two regimes emerged for low and high stellar mass galaxies, distinctly separated at approximately ${\rm M_{\star}} >10^{9.75}$.
  Low-mass galaxies with strong positive $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$ appear less enriched than the MZR median, while those with strong negative gradients are consistently more enriched in both simulated and observed samples. Interestingly, low-mass galaxies with strong negative $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$ exhibit high star-forming activity, regardless of stellar surface density or $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$. In contrast, a discrepancy arises for massive galaxies between MaNGA and \textsc{eagle} datasets. The latter exhibit a notable anticorrelation between specific star formation rate and stellar surface density, independent of $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$, while MaNGA galaxies show this trend mainly for strong positive $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$. Further investigation indicates that galaxies with strong negative gradients tend to host smaller central black holes in observed datasets, a trend not replicated in simulations.

Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring.Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.
  Our development of differential geometry in terms of algebraifolds comprises tensors, connections, curvature, geodesics and we briefly consider general relativity.",{'geodesics': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Spectroscopic Searches for Evolutionary Orbital Period Changes in WR+OB Binaries: the Case of WR 127 (Hen 3-1772),https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06473v1,"I. A. Shaposhnikov, A. M. Cherepashchuk, A. V.

We performed new low-resolution spectroscopic observations of WR 127 on 2.5-m CMO SAI telescope to construct the radial velocity curves of the components suggesting the component masses $M_\mathrm{WR}\sin^3(i) = 11.8\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{O}\sin^3(i)=17.2\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$. The comparison with archival radial velocity curves enabled us to calculate the $(O-C)$ plot with accuracy sufficient to search for the orbital period change in WR 127. We report on the reliable detection of a secular increase in the orbital period of WR 127 at a rate of $\dot{P} = 0.83\pm0.14~\mbox{s~yr}^{-1}$ corresponding to the dynamical mass-loss rate from the WR star $\dot{M}_\mathrm{WR} = (2.6\pm0.5)\times 10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass-loss rate from WR stars in three WR+OB binaries (WR 127, CX Cep and V444 Cyg) as inferred from spectroscopic and photometric measurements suggests a preliminary empirical correlation between the WR star mass and the dynamical mass-loss rate $\dot M_\mathrm{WR}\sim M_\mathrm{WR}^{1.8}$.

Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06416v2,"Yihan Wang, Bing Zhang","The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

The sample was classified as type-1 and type-2 AGN using optical spectral and morphological classification while the host galaxy properties were estimated with multiwavelength SED fitting. For type-1 AGN, the black hole mass was determined from MgII emission lines while the black hole mass of type-2 AGN was inferred from the host galaxy's stellar mass. Based on the derived parameters, the distribution of the sample in the absorption hydrogen column density ($N_{\rm H}$) vs. Eddington ratio diagram is examined. Among the type-2 AGN, $28\pm5$\% are in the forbidden zone, where the obscuration by dust torus cannot be maintained due to radiation pressure on dusty material. The fraction is higher than that observed in the local universe from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) data release 2 ($11\pm3$\%). The higher fraction implies that the obscuration of the majority of AGN is consistent with the radiation pressure regulated unified model but with an increased incidence of interstellar matter (ISM) obscured AGN. We discuss the possibility of dust-free absorption in type-1 AGN and heavy ISM absorption in type-2 AGN.

Near-term quantum computers may bring considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational Ansätze are proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model.

Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light.

We find that the allowed parameter space is heavily dependent on the shape of the inflaton potential during reheating (determined by the exponent of the potential $n$), the energy density of PBHs (determined by $β$), and the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM). To complete the minimal gravitational framework, we also include in our analysis the gravitational leptogenesis set-up through inflaton scattering via exchange of graviton, which opens up an even larger window for PBH mass, depending on the background equation of state.

The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation.

In particular, the two central charges of these theories are the same, namely $a=c$. We derive a simple and illuminating formula for the Schur index of these theories, which factorizes into the product of a Casimir term and a term referred to as the Schur partition function. While the former is controlled by the anomaly, the latter is identified with the vacuum character of the corresponding chiral algebra and is expected to satisfy the modular linear differential equation. Our simple expression for the Schur partition function, which can be regarded as the generalization of MacMahon's generalized sum-of-divisor function, allows one to numerically compute the series expansions efficiently, and furthermore find the corresponding modular linear differential equation. In a special case where the chiral algebra is known, we are able to derive the corresponding modular linear differential equation using Zhu's recursion relation. We further study the solutions to the modular linear differential equations and discuss their modular transformations. As an application, we study the high temperature limit or the Cardy-like limit of the Schur index using its simple expression and modular properties, thus shedding light on the 1/4-BPS microstates of genuine $\mathcal N=2$ SCFTs with $a=c$ and their dual quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT correspondence.",{'AdS/CFT': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']

In this paper, we present the optical photo-, spectro-, and polarimetry of a recent TDE candidate AT 2022fpx, in addition to accompanying monitoring observations in ultraviolet and X-rays.

Variational quantum eigensolver with linear depth problem-inspired ansatz for solving portfolio optimization in finance,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04296v1,"Shengbin Wang, Peng Wang, Guihui Li, Shubin Zhao, Dongyi Zhao, Jing Wang, Yuan Fang, Menghan Dou, Yongjian Gu, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo","Great efforts have been dedicated in recent years to explore practical applications for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, which is a fundamental and challenging problem in quantum computing. As one of the most promising methods, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has been extensively studied. In this paper, VQE is applied to solve portfolio optimization problems in finance by designing two hardware-efficient Dicke state ansatze that reach a maximum of 2n two-qubit gate depth and n^2/4 parameters, with n being the number of qubits used. Both ansatze are partitioning-friendly, allowing for the proposal of a highly scalable quantum/classical hybrid distributed computing (HDC) scheme. Combining simultaneous sampling, problem-specific measurement error mitigation, and fragment reuse techniques, we successfully implement the HDC experiments on the superconducting quantum computer Wu Kong with up to 55 qubits. The simulation and experimental results illustrate that the restricted expressibility of the ansatze, induced by the small number of parameters and limited entanglement, is advantageous for solving classical optimization problems with the cost function of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) for the NISQ era and beyond. Furthermore, the HDC scheme shows great potential for achieving quantum advantage in the NISQ era.

Error Correction in Dynamical Codes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04163v1,"Xiaozhen Fu, Daniel Gottesman","We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.",{'quantum error-correcting code': 1},03.2024,2024,03,"['Holography', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

For these EKBHs, the probability of ever absorbing a photon or other particle from the cosmic environment is small, even in the cores of galaxies.

We derive the SFR of 10$^{3.0\pm0.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ using PAH 3.3$μ$m, which is five times higher than that derived from the cutoff luminosity of the infrared luminosity function for galaxies at $z\sim2$. While the SFR of J0749+2255 agrees with that of star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass at the same redshifts, its molecular gas content falls short of expectations based on the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. This discrepancy may result from molecular gas depletion due to the longer elevated stage of star formation, even after the molecular gas reservoir is depleted. We do not observe any quasar-driven outflow that impacts PAH and [Fe II] in the host galaxy based on the spatially resolved maps. From the expected flux in PAH-based star formation, the [Fe II] line likely originates from the star-forming regions in the host galaxy.

The impact of AGN X-ray selection on the AGN halo occupation distribution,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03978v1,"M. C. Powell, M. Krumpe, A. Coil, T. Miyaji","The connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host dark matter halos provides powerful insights into how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow and coevolve with their host galaxies. Here we investigate the impact of observational AGN selection on the AGN halo occupation distribution (HOD) by forward-modeling AGN activity into cosmological N-body simulations. By assuming straightforward relationships between the SMBH mass, galaxy mass, and (sub)halo mass, as well as a uniform broken power law distribution of Eddington ratios, we find that luminosity-limited AGN samples result in biased HOD shapes. While AGN defined by an Eddington ratio threshold produce AGN fractions that are flat across halo mass (unbiased by definition), luminosity-limited AGN fractions peak around galaxy-group-sized halo masses and then decrease with increasing halo mass. With higher luminosities, the rise of the AGN fraction starts at higher halo masses, the peak is shifted towards higher halo masses, and the decline at higher halo masses is more rapid. These results are consistent with recent HOD constraints from AGN clustering measurements, which find (1) characteristic halo mass scales of $\log M_{Vir}\sim$ 12 - 13 [$h^{-1}M_{\odot}$] and (2) a shallower rise of the number of satellite AGN with increasing halo mass than for the overall galaxy population. Thus the observational biases due to AGN selection can naturally explain the constant, characteristic halo mass scale inferred from large-scale AGN clustering amplitudes over a range of redshifts, as well as the measured inconsistencies between AGN and galaxy HODs. We conclude that AGN selection biases can have significant impacts on the inferred AGN HOD, and can therefore lead to possible misinterpretations of how AGN populate dark matter halos and the AGN-host galaxy connection.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

How open is the asteroid-mass primordial black hole window?,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03839v1,"Matthew Gorton, Anne M.

Observational constraints on the abundance of PBHs are usually calculated assuming they all have the same mass, however this is unlikely to be a good approximation. PBHs formed from the collapse of large density perturbations during radiation domination are expected to have an extended mass function (MF), due to the effects of critical collapse. The PBH MF is often assumed to be lognormal, however it has recently been shown that other functions are a better fit to numerically calculated MFs. We recalculate both current and potential future constraints for these improved fitting functions. We find that for current constraints the asteroid-mass window narrows, but remains open (i.e. all of the DM can be in the form of PBHs) unless the PBH MF is wider than expected. Future evaporation and microlensing constraints may together exclude all of the DM being in PBHs, depending on the width of the PBH MF and also the shape of its low and high mass tails.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

The finite-temperature absorption, steady-stat emission, and time-resolved emission spectra are then computed using powerful, numerically exact tensor network approaches.

On GR dragging and effective galactic dark matter,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03227v1,"Federico Re, Marco Galoppo","In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of papers regarding general-relativistic explanations for the dark matter phenomena in disc galaxies. The main focus of this scientific discussion is whether a previously unexamined relativistic dragging vortex could support flat rotation curves, with various research groups taking different stances on its feasibility. In this paper, we discuss the different points of view by placing the various arguments within a general theoretical context. We explicitly state the conceptual assumptions, and indicate what we believe to be the correct interpretation for the physical quantities of interest. We show how the dragging conjecture fails under certain hypotheses, and discuss the flaws of the most common dragging models: the linearised gravitomagnetic description and the one of Balasin&Grumiller. On the other hand, we illustrate how to avoid failure scenarios for the conjecture, emphasizing the features for a physically reasonable disc galaxy dragging model. In particular, we stress that the non-linearities of the Einstein Equations must play an essential role in generating what we define as ``pseudo-solitonic"" solutions -- the only non-trivial physically viable solutions for the class of models considered. Furthermore, the dragging vortex is proven to show important contributions to the gravitational lensing in these models, thus providing an ulterior measure of its relevance. Moreover, by qualitatively exploring these pseudo-solitonic solutions, we find that a dragging speed of just a few kilometers per second would be enough to explain a non-negligible fraction of the galactic dark matter. Finally, we propose and analyse the feasibility of three independent measurements which could be carried out to detect the presence of dragging vortices in disc galaxies.",{'einstein equations': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.","{'geodesics': 1, 'tensor network': 2}",03.2024,2024,03,"['Tensor Networks', 'Black Holes and GR']"
Solving non-native combinatorial optimization problems using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03153v1,"Jonathan Wurtz, Stefan Sack, Sheng-Tao Wang","Combinatorial optimization is a challenging problem applicable in a wide range of fields from logistics to finance. Recently, quantum computing has been used to attempt to solve these problems using a range of algorithms, including parameterized quantum circuits, adiabatic protocols, and quantum annealing. These solutions typically have several challenges: 1) there is little to no performance gain over classical methods, 2) not all constraints and objectives may be efficiently encoded in the quantum ansatz, and 3) the solution domain of the objective function may not be the same as the bit strings of measurement outcomes. This work presents ""non-native hybrid algorithms"" (NNHA): a framework to overcome these challenges by integrating quantum and classical resources with a hybrid approach. By designing non-native quantum variational ansatzes that inherit some but not all problem structure, measurement outcomes from the quantum computer can act as a resource to be used by classical routines to indirectly compute optimal solutions, partially overcoming the challenges of contemporary quantum optimization approaches. These methods are demonstrated using a publicly available neutral-atom quantum computer on two simple problems of Max $k$-Cut and maximum independent set.

These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can ""start"" or ""break"" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination.

Quantum Algorithms in a Superposition of Spacetimes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02937v1,Omri Shmueli,"Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize our ability to process information. The advancement from classical to quantum computing is a product of our advancement from classical to quantum physics -- the more our understanding of the universe grows, so does our ability to use it for computation. A natural question that arises is, what will physics allow in the future? Can more advanced theories of physics increase our computational power, beyond quantum computing?
  An active field of research in physics studies theoretical phenomena outside the scope of explainable quantum mechanics, that form when attempting to combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) with General Relativity (GR) into a unified theory of Quantum Gravity (QG). QG is known to present the possibility of a quantum superposition of causal structure and event orderings. In the literature of quantum information theory, this translates to a superposition of unitary evolution orders.
  In this work we show a first example of a natural computational model based on QG, that provides an exponential speedup over standard quantum computation (under standard hardness assumptions). We define a model and complexity measure for a quantum computer that has the ability to generate a superposition of unitary evolution orders, and show that such computer is able to solve in polynomial time two of the fundamental problems in computer science: The Graph Isomorphism Problem ($\mathsf{GI}$) and the Gap Closest Vector Problem ($\mathsf{GapCVP}$), with gap $O\left( n^{2} \right)$. These problems are believed by experts to be hard to solve for a regular quantum computer.

Primordial black hole formation processes with full numerical relativity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02878v1,Eloy de Jong,"See thesis for complete abstract.
  Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form in the early universe, and there are several mass windows in which their abundance today may be large enough to comprise a significant part of the dark matter density. Additionally, numerical relativity (NR) allows one to investigate the formation processes of PBHs in the fully nonlinear strong-gravity regime. In this thesis, we will describe the use of NR methods to study PBH formation, motivated in particular by open questions about the nonspherical effects PBH formation in a matter-dominated early universe.
  We demonstrate that superhorizon non-linear perturbations can collapse and form PBHs via the direct collapse or the accretion collapse mechanisms in a matter-dominated universe. The heaviest perturbations collapse via the direct collapse mechanism, while lighter perturbations trigger an accretion process that causes a rapid collapse of the ambient DM. From the hoop conjecture we propose an analytic criterion to determine whether a given perturbation will collapse via the direct or accretion mechanism and we compute the timescale of collapse. Independent of the formation mechanism, the PBH forms within an efold after collapse is initiated and with a small initial mass compared to the Hubble horizon, $M_\textrm{BH} H_0\sim 10^{-2}m_\mathrm{Pl}^2$. Finally, we find that PBH formation is followed by extremely rapid growth $M_\textrm{BH}\propto H^{-β}$ with $β\gg 1$, during which the PBH acquires most of its mass.
  Furthermore, we study the formation of spinning primordial black holes during an early matter-dominated era. Using non-linear 3+1D general relativistic simulations, we compute the efficiency of mass and angular momentum transfer in the process -- which we find to be $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$.

Since the pressure is given in terms of a negative cosmological constant (which parametrizes the vacuum energy), the holographic interpretation of Black Hole Chemistry has remained unclear.

A subset of the detected BNS systems can retain residual eccentricity in the detector frequency band. We study the systematic errors due to unmodeled eccentricity in the tidal deformability measurement and its implications for NS EoS and redshift measurement via the Love siren method. We find that the systematic errors in the tidal deformability parameter exceed the statistical errors at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$) at $10$Hz reference GW frequency for CE (ET). We show that these biases on tidal deformability parameter can significantly bias the NS EoS inference. Furthermore, the error on tidal deformability propagates to the source frame NS mass, which in turn biases the redshift inference. For CE, the redshift inference is significantly biased at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ (at a reference frequency of $10$Hz). We also study the implications of biased tidal deformability in testing the Kerr nature of black holes. Systematic error on the tidal deformability parameter leads to a non-zero value of tidal deformability for binary black holes, indicating a false deviation from the Kerr nature. Finally, we show that including eccentricity in the waveform model increases the statistical errors in tidal deformability measurement by a factor of $\lesssim 2$.

If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years.

Relational bulk reconstruction from modular flow,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02377v1,"Onkar Parrikar, Harshit Rajgadia, Vivek Singh, Jonathan Sorce","The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion $\bar{A}$, operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on $\bar{A}$. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion $A$. In this paper, we set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography: given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region $A$, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces. To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure of $A$, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in holography in a ""measurement-based"" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this connection more rigorous.

With variable scalar curvature, however, asymptotically-flat symmergent black hole solutions turn out to explicitly depend on the quadratic curvature term. In the present work, we construct asymptotically-flat symmergent black holes with variable scalar curvature and use its evaporation, shadow, and deflection angle to constrain the symmergent gravity parameters. Concerning their evaporation, we find that the new particles predicted by symmergent gravity, even if they do not interact with the known particles, can enhance the black hole evaporation rate. Concerning their shadow, we show that statistically significant symmergent effects are reached at the $2\,σ$ level for the observational data of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) on the Sagittarius A* supermassive black hole. Concerning their weak deflection angle, we reveal discernible features for the boson-fermion number differences, particularly at large impact parameters. These findings hold the potential to serve as theoretical predictions for future observations and investigations on black hole properties.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Holographic entropy bound and a special class of spatial systems in cosmology,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02362v1,"Hao Yu, Zi-Chao Lin, Jin Li","The holographic entropy bound is discussed in cosmology. We try to define a special class of spatial systems in cosmology, inside which the entropy of matter satisfies the holographic entropy bound throughout the evolution of the universe. We first take a universe composed of black holes as an example and demonstrate that such a special class of systems does exist. Then, from the perspective of entropy inside the co-moving volume, we find that there exists a universal definition for this special class of spatial systems, i.e., the definition is independent of the components of the universe. Finally, we prove that in some specific cosmological models, multiple definitions can arise for this special class of spatial systems, and we analyze the underlying reasons for the emergence of these multiple definitions.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Probing the Circum-Galactic Medium with Fast Radio Bursts: Insights from the CAMELS Simulations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02313v1,"Isabel Medlock, Daisuke Nagai, Priyanka Singh, Benjamin Oppenheimer, Daniel Anglés Alcázar, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro","Most diffuse baryons, including the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the cosmic web, remain unmeasured and unconstrained. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) offer an unparalleled method to measure the electron dispersion measures (DMs) of ionized baryons. Their distribution can resolve the missing baryon problem, and constrain the history of feedback theorized to impart significant energy to the CGM and IGM. We analyze the Cosmology and Astrophysics in Machine Learning (CAMEL) Simulations, using three suites: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid, each varying 6 parameters (2 cosmological & 4 astrophysical feedback), for a total of 183 distinct simulation models. We find significantly different predictions between the fiducial models of the suites, owing to their different implementations of feedback. SIMBA exhibits the strongest feedback, leading to the smoothest distribution of baryons, reducing the sightline-to-sightline variance in DMs between z=0-1. Astrid has the weakest feedback and the largest variance. We calculate FRB CGM measurements as a function of galaxy impact parameter, with SIMBA showing the weakest DMs due to aggressive AGN feedback and Astrid the strongest. Within each suite, the largest differences are due to varying AGN feedback. IllustrisTNG shows the most sensitivity to supernova feedback, but this is due to the change in the AGN feedback strengths, demonstrating that black holes, not stars, are most capable of redistributing baryons in the IGM and CGM. We compare our statistics directly to recent observations, paving the way for the use of FRBs to constrain the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $μ$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim4$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$α$ EW $\sim800$Å). The widths and luminosities of Pa$β$, Pa$δ$, Pa$γ$, and H$α$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

The latter consists, on-shell, of a flat superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra. The 4D HSG and 3D CCHSG reductions are characterized by dual structure groups and two-form cohomology elements, and their embedding in a common parent model provides a rationale for deriving holographic relations from multi-dimensional AKSZ partition functions on cylinders with dual boundary conditions, to appear separately.

Projective path to points at infinity in spherically symmetric spacetimes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02128v1,"Donato Bini, Giampiero Esposito","This paper points out that, in a four-dimensional spacetime manifold, the four coordinates of any point may be viewed as arising from five homogeneous coordinates according to the well-established recipes of projective geometry. Moreover, if the homogeneous coordinates change by a linear transformation, ruled by the coefficients of a matrix of the group GL(5,R), this induces a fractional linear transformation of spherically symmetric spacetime coordinates which can be exploited to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. For the single points, the underlying structure is a projective map which destroys the 2-sphere, whereas the two products of a half-line with the 2-sphere arise from a projective map which preserves the 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai and de Sitter spacetimes are studied with our projective method.

We employ fully nonlinear numerical evolutions of both scalarized black holes with and without stable light rings, perturbing them initially with spherically symmetric scalar perturbations. Our simulations demonstrate the long-term stability of these scalarized black holes, suggesting that the presence of a stable light ring may not necessarily induce the light-ring instability.",{'black holes': 4},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Recursive Quantum Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization Problems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02045v1,"Ruho Kondo, Yuki Sato, Rudy Raymond, Naoki Yamamoto","Quantum optimization methods use a continuous degree-of-freedom of quantum states to heuristically solve combinatorial problems, such as the MAX-CUT problem, which can be attributed to various NP-hard combinatorial problems.

Combining this finding with the concept of quantum random access codes (QRACs) for encoding bits into quantum states on fewer qubits, we propose an efficient recursive quantum relaxation method called recursive quantum random access optimization (RQRAO) for MAX-CUT. Experiments on standard benchmark graphs with several hundred nodes in the MAX-CUT problem, conducted in a fully classical manner using a tensor network technique, show that RQRAO outperforms the Goemans--Williamson method and is comparable to state-of-the-art classical solvers.

Holographic Einstein Ring of a Charged Rastall AdS Black Hole with Bulk Electromagnetic Field,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01995v1,"M. Israr Aslam, Xiao-Xiong Zeng, Rabia Saleem, Xin-Yun Hu","We study the Einstein images of a charged Rastall AdS black hole (BH) within the fabric of AdS/CFT correspondence. Considering the holographic setup, we analyze the amplitude of the total response function for various values of model parameters. With an increase in parameter $λ$ and temperature $T$, the amplitude of the response function is decreased, while it is increased with the increase of the electric charge $e$ and chemical potential $μ$. The influence of frequency $ω$ also plays an important role in the bulk field, as it is found that the decreasing $ω$ leads to an increase in the periods of the waves, which means that the amplitude of the response function also depends on the wave source. The relation between $T$ to the inverse of the horizon $r_{h}$ for the parameter $λ$ is interpreted under fixed values of other involved parameters. These, in turn, affect the behavior of the response function and the Einstein ring, which may be used to differentiate the present work from previous studies. Via a special optical system, we construct the holographic images of the BH in bulk. The obtained results show that the Einstein ring always appears with concentric stripes at the position of the north pole, and this ring transforms into the luminosity-deformed ring or bright light spot when the distant observer lies away from the north pole. Moreover, from the brightness profiles, it is observed that as $λ$ grows, the shadow radius is significantly decreased, while the brightness of the ring is negligibly changed. We further investigate the influence of $T$ and $μ$ on the ring radius. These results reveal that the increasing values of $T$ lead to an increase in the shadow radius and decrease as the values of $μ$ grow. Finally, we finish this work with a discussion of the Einstein ring radius obtained by geometric optics, which is consistent with wave optics.",{'AdS/CFT': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']

Exterior solutions are particularly interesting since they may lead to a semiclassical version of the Birkhoff's theorem.

Firstly, we explore the validity of the null, weak, dominant and strong energy conditions for wormhole matter for the considered $f(R,T)=R+αR^2+λT$ model. Research shows that it is possible to obtain traversable WH geometry without bring in exotic matter that violates the null energy condition in the $f(R,T)$ theory. The violation of the dominant energy condition in this model may be related to quantum fluctuations or indicates the existence of special matter that violates this EC within the wormhole. Moreover, it is found that in the $f(R,T)=R+αR^2+λT$ model, relative to the GR, the introduction of the geometric term $αR^2$ has no remarkable impact on the wormhole matter components and their properties, while the appearance of the matter-geometry coupling term $λT$ can resolve the question that WH matter violates the null, weak and strong energy condition in GR. Additionally, we investigate dependency of the valid NEC on model parameters and quantify the matter components within the wormhole using the ``volume integral quantifier"". Lastly, based on the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation, we find that the traversable WH in this theory is stable. On the other hand, we use the classical reconstruction technique to derive wormhole solution in $f(R,T)$ theory and discuss the corresponding ECs of matter. It is found that all four ECs (NEC, WEC, SEC and DEC) of matter in the traversable wormholes are valid in this reconstructed $f(R,T)$ model, i.e we provide a wormhole solution without introducing the exotic matter and special matter in $f(R,T)$ theory.",{'traversable wormholes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Radio AGN jet alignment: Radio and Optical Position Angle of Radio Galaxies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01707v1,"Xuechen Zheng, Yuze Zhang, Huub Röttgering","It is well established that AGNs play an important role in the evolution of galaxies. These AGNs can be linked to the accretion processes onto massive black holes and past merger events in their host galaxies, which may lead to different alignments of the jets with respect to the host galaxies. This paper presents a study of the PA differences between radio and optical images of radio AGNs based on the LoTSS DR2, the FIRST, the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and the SDSS. We assessed PA measurement biases in the data and classified the radio AGNs based on the radio luminosity and infrared colour from the WISE. This resulted in the largest yet published sample of 3682 radio AGNs with reliable radio and optical PA measurements. The PA difference (dPA) distributions for the radio AGN sample show a prominent minor-axis alignment tendency. Based on some simple assumptions, we simulated the projection effect to estimate the intrinsic jet-galaxy alignment. The observed dPA distribution can be well described by a two-component jet-alignment model in which one component is more aligned with the minor axis of the host galaxy than the other. The fitting results indicate that the jet alignment is dependent on radio luminosity and the shape of the host galaxies, with the jets being more likely to be aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy for lower radio luminosity and for optically more elongated radio AGNs. The minor-axis alignment of the entire sample may suggest a coherent accretion model present in most AGN host galaxies, while a considerable number of luminous radio-AGN with massive host galaxies might have undergone an accretion according to the chaotic model or past merger events.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Computing exact moments of local random quantum circuits via tensor networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01706v1,"Paolo Braccia, Pablo Bermejo, Lukasz Cincio, M. Cerezo","A basic primitive in quantum information is the computation of the moments $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[UρU^\dagger O]^t]$. These describe the distribution of expectation values obtained by sending a state $ρ$ through a random unitary $U$, sampled from some distribution, and measuring the observable $O$. While the exact calculation of these moments is generally hard, if $U$ is composed of local random gates, one can estimate $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[UρU^\dagger O]^t]$ by performing Monte Carlo simulations of a Markov chain-like process. However, this approach can require a prohibitively large number of samples, or suffer from the sign problem. In this work, we instead propose to estimate the moments via tensor networks, where the local gates moment operators are mapped to small dimensional tensors acting on their local commutant bases. By leveraging representation theoretical tools, we study the local tensor dimension and we provide bounds for the bond dimension of the matrix product states arising from deep circuits. We compare our techniques against Monte Carlo simulations, showing that we can significantly out-perform them. Then, we showcase how tensor networks can exactly compute the second moment when $U$ is a quantum neural network acting on thousands of qubits and having thousands of gates. To finish, we numerically study the anticoncentration phenomena of circuits with orthogonal random gates, a task which cannot be studied via Monte Carlo due to sign problems.",{'tensor networks': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Tensor Networks']
Inverted-circuit zero-noise extrapolation for quantum gate error mitigation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01608v1,"Kathrin F. Koenig, Finn Reinecke, Walter Hahn, Thomas Wellens","A common approach to deal with gate errors in modern quantum-computing hardware is zero-noise extrapolation. By artificially amplifying errors and extrapolating the expectation values obtained with different error strengths towards the zero-error (zero-noise) limit, the technique aims at rectifying errors in noisy quantum computing systems. For an accurate extrapolation, it is essential to know the exact factors of the noise amplification. In this article, we propose a simple method for estimating the strength of errors occurring in a quantum circuit and demonstrate improved extrapolation results. The method determines the error strength for a circuit by appending to it the inverted circuit and measuring the probability of the initial state. The estimation of error strengths is easy to implement for arbitrary circuits and does not require a previous characterisation of noise properties. We compare this method with the conventional zero-noise extrapolation method and show that the novel method leads to a more accurate calculation of expectation values. Our method proves to be particularly effective on current hardware, showcasing its suitability for near-term quantum computing applications.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

To this end, we propose and demonstrate transmission-based dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit using an all-pass resonator that preferentially emits readout photons in one direction. This is in contrast to typical readout schemes, which intentionally mismatch the feedline at one end so that the readout signal preferentially decays toward the output. We show that this intentional mismatch creates scaling challenges, including larger spread of effective resonator linewidths due to non-ideal impedance environments and added infrastructure for impedance matching.

Through comprehensive design space exploration of state-of-the-art quantum addition building blocks, our work have resulted in an impressive achievement: a reduction in Toffoli Depth of up to 94.06%, accompanied by substantial reductions in both Toffoli and Qubit Count of up to 91.98% and 99.37%, respectively. This paper offers crucial perspectives on efficient design of quantum dividers, and emphasizes the importance of adopting a systematic design space exploration approach.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Study of charged gravastar model in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01094v1,"Debasmita Mohanty, Sayantan Ghosh, P. K.

Modified Symmetric teleparallel equivalent of gravity also has seen quite a few successes in recent years both in cosmology as well as in astrophysical objects like black holes and wormholes. In this paper, we have considered the charged gravastar in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ formulation and have solved it fully analytically and found various physical characteristics like energy density, entropy and EoS for the gravastar. We have used the Israel junction condition to make some phenomenological predictions regarding the potential of the thin shell around the gravastar. We have also studied the deflection of the angle caused by the gravastar. Finally, we conclude by noting how future radio telescopes could detect the gravastar shadow and how can one distinguish it from the black hole event horizon.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+Λ_2$,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01040v1,"Gauri Batra, G. Bruno De Luca, Eva Silverstein, Gonzalo Torroba, Sungyeon Yang","We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+Λ_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+Λ_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields.

In general relativity, for Schwarzschild spacetime, an equilibrium sphere (the Eddington Capture Sphere) is formed for near-Eddington luminosities. We generalize these results to a broad class of static, spherical spacetimes. We also study the dynamics of particles in a strong radiation field in spherical spacetimes. The results are illustrated for two cases, Reissner-Nordström spacetime of a charged spherical object in general relativity and Kehagias-Sfetsos spacetime, arising from the Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory. Our findings apply to neutron stars under gravitational field equations different from the vacuum Einstein field equations of general relativity, such as in modified theories of gravity, the only requirement being that test particles follow geodesics in the absence of the radiation field.

Scalable Quantum Algorithms for Noisy Quantum Computers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00940v1,Julien Gacon,"Quantum computing not only holds the potential to solve long-standing problems in quantum physics, but also to offer speed-ups across a broad spectrum of other fields. However, due to the noise and the limited scale of current quantum computers, may prominent quantum algorithms are currently infeasible to run for problem sizes of practical interest. This doctoral thesis develops two main techniques to reduce the quantum computational resource requirements, with the goal of scaling up application sizes on current quantum processors. The first approach is based on stochastic approximations of computationally costly quantities, such as quantum circuit gradients or the quantum geometric tensor (QGT). The second method takes a different perspective on the QGT, leading to a potentially more efficient description of time evolution on current quantum computers. While the main focus of application for our algorithms is the simulation of quantum systems, the developed subroutines can further be utilized in the fields of optimization or machine learning. Our algorithms are benchmarked on a range of representative models, such as Ising or Heisenberg spin models, both in numerical simulations and experiments on the hardware. In combination with error mitigation techniques, the latter is scaled up to 27 qubits; into a regime that variational quantum algorithms are challenging to scale to on noisy quantum computers without our algorithms.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Interestingly enough, the existence of primordial NG can leave imprints on the clustering properties of PBHs and the spectral shape of induced GW signals. Focusing on a scale-dependent local-type NG, we identify a distinct double-peaked GW energy spectrum that, contingent upon $M_{\text{PBH}}$ and the abundance of PBHs at the time of formation, denoted as $Ω_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, may fall into the frequency bands of upcoming GW observatories, including LISA, ET, SKA, and BBO. Thus, such a signal can serve as a novel portal for probing primordial NGs. Intriguingly, combining BBN bounds on the GW amplitude, we find for the first time the joint limit on the product of the effective non-linearity parameter for the primordial tri-spectrum, denoted by $\barτ_\mathrm{NL}$, and the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k)$, which reads as $\barτ_\mathrm{NL} \mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k) < 4\times 10^{-20} Ω^{-17/9}_\mathrm{PBH,f} \left( \frac{M_{\rm PBH}}{10^4\mathrm{g}} \right)^{-17/9}$.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Comment on &#34;Controlled Bond Expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization Group Ground State Search at Single-Site Costs&#34; (Extended Version),https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00562v1,"Ian P McCulloch, Jesse Osborne","In a recent Letter [Phys.

The Controlled Bond Expansion (CBE) algorithm uses the Hamiltonian projected onto two sites, and then further projected onto the two-site tangent space, to extract a set of $k$ vectors that are used to expand the basis between the two sites. CBE achieves this with a complicated sequence of five singular value decompositions (SVDs), in order to project onto the 2-site tangent space and reduce the bond dimension of the tensor network such that the contraction can be done in time $O(dwD^3)$. In this Comment, we show that (1) the projection onto the 2-site tangent space is unnecessary, and is generally not helpful; (2) the sequence of 5 SVDs can be replaced by a single $QR$ decomposition (optionally with one SVD as well), making use of the randomized SVD (RSVD) with high accuracy and significantly improved efficiency, scaling as $O(dwkD^2)$ i.e., the most expensive operations are only quadratic in the bond dimension $D$ and linear in the number of expansion vectors $k$; (3) several statements about the variational properties of the CBE algorithm are incorrect, and the variational properties are essentially identical to existing algorithms including 2-site DMRG and single-site subspace expansion (3S); (4) a similar RSVD approach can be applied to the 3S algorithm, which leads to many advantages over CBE, especially in systems with long range interactions.

Observational Evidence for Hot Wind Impact on pc-scale in Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00479v1,"Fangzheng Shi, Feng Yuan, Zhiyuan Li, Zhao Su, Suoqing Ji","Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperature around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several $10^3$ km/s and lower temperature (~0.2-0.4 keV). Blue-shifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to be explained by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blue-shifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidences for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Phase retrieval beyond the homogeneous object assumption for X-ray in-line holographic imaging,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00461v1,"Jens Lucht, Leon M.

Here, we demonstrate an efficient phase retrieval algorithm that does not rely on this homogeneous-object assumption and is a generalization of the well-established contrast-transfer-function (CTF) approach. We then investigate its stability and present an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithm with established methods. The algorithm shows superior reconstruction quality compared to the established CTF-based method at similar computational cost.

This is a notable characteristic of the General Relativity Theory. The current article discusses traversable wormhole solutions in $f(R, L, T)=R+αL+βT$, with $α$ and $β$ are model parameters. The wormhole solutions presented here satisfy the metric constraints of traversability while remarkably avoiding the exotic matter condition, indicating that $f(R, L, T)$ gravity wormholes can be filled with ordinary matter.

The central region in each galaxy contains a circumnuclear disk that exhibits orderly rotation with projected line-of-sight velocities of ${\sim} 270\, \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. We build gas-dynamical models for the rotating disk in each galaxy and fit them directly to the ALMA data cubes. At $0.31^{\prime \prime}$resolution, the ALMA observations do not fully resolve the black hole sphere of influence (SOI), and neither galaxy exhibits a central rise in rotation speed, indicating that emission from deep within the SOI is not detected. As a result, our models do not tightly constrain the central black hole mass in either galaxy, but they prefer the presence of a central massive object in both galaxies. We measure the black hole mass to be $(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/10^8\, M_{\odot}) = 5.0 \pm 0.2 \,[\mathrm{1σ\,statistical}] \,^{+1.4}_{-1.3} \,[\mathrm{systematic}]$ in NGC 4786 and $(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/10^8\, M_{\odot}) = 1.4 \pm 0.03 \, [\mathrm{1σ\,statistical}] ^{+1.5}_{-0.1} \,[\mathrm{systematic}]$ in NGC 5193.

Enabling large-depth simulation of noisy quantum circuits with positive tensor networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00152v1,"Ambroise Müller, Thomas Ayral, Corentin Bertrand","Matrix product density operators (MPDOs) are tensor network representations of locally purified density matrices where each physical degree of freedom is associated to an environment degree of freedom. MPDOs have interesting properties for mixed state representations: guaranteed positivity by construction, efficient conservation of the trace and computation of local observables. However, they have been challenging to use for noisy quantum circuit simulation, as the application of noise increases the dimension of the environment Hilbert space, leading to an exponential growth of bond dimensions. MPDOs also lack a unique canonical form, due to the freedom in the choice of basis for the environment Hilbert space, which leads to a vast variation of bond dimensions.
  In this work, we present a systematic way to reduce the bond dimensions of MPDOs by disentangling the purified state. We optimize the basis for the environment Hilbert space by performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-like sweeps of local 2-qubit basis optimization. Interestingly, we find that targeting only the disentanglement of the purified state leads to a reduction of the environment dimension. In other words, a compact MPDO representation requires a low-entanglement purified state.
  We apply our compression method to the emulation of noisy random quantum circuits. Our technique allows us to keep bounded bond dimensions, and thus bounded memory, contrary to previous works on MPDOs, while keeping reasonable truncation fidelities.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'random quantum circuits': 1, 'tensor network': 1}",03.2024,2024,03,"['Tensor Networks', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

Latest results claim supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these systems to be significantly more massive than expected from the local BH mass - stellar mass ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$) relation and that this is not due to sample selection effects. Through detailed statistical modeling, we demonstrate that the coupled effects of selection biases (i.e., finite detection limit and requirements on detecting broad lines) and measurement uncertainties in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$ and $\mathcal{M}_\star$ can in fact largely account for the reported offset and flattening in the observed $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation toward the upper envelope of the local relation, even for those at $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} < 10^8\,M_{\odot}$. We further investigate the possible evolution of the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation at $z\gtrsim 4$ with careful treatment of observational biases and consideration of the degeneracy between intrinsic evolution and dispersion in this relation. The bias-corrected intrinsic $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation in the low-mass regime suggests that there might be a large population of low-mass BHs (${\rm log}\,\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} \lesssim 5$), possibly originating from lighter seeds, remaining undetected or unidentified even in the deepest JWST surveys.

Probing AGN jet precession with LISA,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00066v1,"Nathan Steinle, Davide Gerosa, Martin G. H. Krause","The precession of astrophysical jets produced by active-galactic nuclei is likely related to the dynamics of the accretion disks surrounding the central supermassive black holes (BHs) from which jets are launched. The two main mechanisms that can drive jet precession arise from Lense-Thirring precession and tidal torquing. These can explain direct and indirect observations of precessing jets; however, such explanations often utilize crude approximations of the disk evolution and observing jet precession can be challenging with electromagnetic facilities. Simultaneously, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to measure gravitational waves from the mergers of massive binary BHs with high accuracy and probe their progenitor evolution. In this paper, we connect the LISA detectability of binary BH mergers to the possible jet precession during their progenitor evolution. We make use of a semi-analytic model that self-consistently treats disk-driven BH alignment and binary inspiral and includes the possibility of disk breaking. We find that tidal torquing of the accretion disk provides a wide range of jet precession timescales depending on the binary separation and the spin direction of the BH from which the jet is launched. Efficient disk-driven BH alignment results in shorter timescales of $\sim 1$ yr which are correlated with higher LISA signal-to-noise ratios. Disk breaking results in the longest possible times of $\sim 10^7$ yrs, suggesting a deep interplay between the disk critical obliquity (i.e. where the disk breaks) and jet precession. Studies such as ours will help to reveal the cosmic population of precessing jets that are detectable with gravitational waves.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

We do not find any significant candidates, but determine the maximum luminosity distance reachable with our search to be of $O(0.1-100)$ kpc, and corresponding model-independent upper limits on the merger rate densities to be $O(10^{3}-10^{-7})$ kpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for systems with chirp masses $O(10^{-4}-10^{-2})M_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, we interpret these rate densities as arising from PBH binaries, and thereby constrain the fraction of dark matter that these objects could compose.

In particular, we discuss in detail the effects of StRVMs on the source as well as on the propagation of these PBH-induced GWs. Remarkably, under the assumption that the logarithmic terms represent quantum gravity corrections in the PBH era, we show that GW overproduction can be avoided if one assumes a coefficient of these logarithmic corrections that is much larger than the square of the reduced Planck mass. The latter cannot characterise quantum gravity corrections, though, prompting the need for revision of the quantisation of StRVMs in different than de Sitter backgrounds, such as those characterising PBH-driven eMD eras. This non trivial result suggests the importance of light PBHs as probes of new physics.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Vacaru, Elşen Veli Veliev, Assel Zhamysheva","We extend the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, AFCDM, for constructing exact and parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, to geometric flow models and modified gravity theories, MGTs, with nontrivial torsion and nonmetricity fields. Following abstract geometric or variational methods, we can derive corresponding systems of nonmetric gravitational and matter field equations which consist of very sophisticated systems of coupled nonlinear PDEs. Using nonholonomic frames with dyadic spacetime splitting and applying the AFCDM, we prove that such systems of PDEs can be decoupled and integrated in general forms for generic off-diagonal metric structures and generalized affine connections. We generate new classes of quasi-stationary solutions (which do not depend on time like coordinates) and study the physical properties of some physically important examples. Such exact or parametric solutions are determined by nonmetric solitonic distributions and/or ellipsoidal deformations of wormhole hole configurations. It is not possible to describe the thermodynamic properties of such solutions in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking paradigm because such metrics do not involve, in general, certain horizons, duality, or holographic configurations. Nevertheless, we can always elaborate on associated Grigori Perelman thermodynamic models elaborated for nonmetric geometric flows. In explicit form, applying the AFCDM, we construct and study the physical implications of new classes of traversable wormhole solutions describing solitonic deformation and dissipation of non-Riemannian geometric objects. Such models with nontrivial gravitational off-diagonal vacuum are important for elaborating models of dark energy and dark matter involving wormhole configurations and solitonic-type structure formation.",{'traversable wormhole': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
New Pathways in Neutrino Physics via Quantum-Encoded Data Analysis,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19306v2,"Jeffrey Lazar, Santiago Giner Olavarrieta, Giancarlo Gatti, Carlos A.

The large data rate requires the use of specialized triggers that promptly reduce the data rate to a manageable level; however, in doing so, unexpected new phenomena may escape detection. Additionally, the large data rate is increasingly difficult to analyze effectively, which has led to a recent revolution on machine learning techniques. Here, we present a methodology based on recent quantum compression techniques that has the capacity to store exponentially more amount of information than classically available methods. To demonstrate this, we encode the full neutrino telescope event information using parity observables in an IBM quantum processor using 8 qubits. Then we show that we can recover the information stored on the quantum computer with a fidelity of 84%. Finally, we illustrate the use of our protocol by performing a classification task that separates electron-neutrino events to muon-neutrinos events in a neutrino telescope. This new capability would eventually allow us to solve the street light effect in particle physics, where we only record signatures of particles with which we are familiar.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Using the framework of trace-preserving completely positive maps, we derive a generalized quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation applicable to arbitrary observables. Exploiting this relation, we establish multiple trade-offs that connect thermodynamic costs with the precision, evolution of observables, and quantum time correlations. We experimentally demonstrate the trade-off relations using superconducting qubits on a quantum computer to verify the theory. The empirical results not only show remarkable agreement with the theoretical predictions but also reveal that the precision of an observable and the quantum time correlator are tightly constrained by the thermodynamic cost.

We perform a Bayesian analysis of the NANOGrav data using the publicly available \textsc{PTArcade} code together with \textsc{SIGWfast} for the numerical integration of the induced gravitational wave spectrum. We focus on two cases: a monochromatic and a log-normal primordial spectrum of fluctuations. For the log-normal spectrum, we show that, while the results are not very sensitive to $w$ when the GW peak is close to the PTA window, radiation domination is out of the $2σ$ contours when only the infra-red power-law tail contributes. For the monochromatic spectrum, the $2σ$ bounds yield $0.1\lesssim w\lesssim0.9$ so that radiation domination is close to the central value. We also investigate the primordial black hole (PBH) counterpart using the peak formalism. We show that, in general terms, a larger width and stiffer equation of state alleviates the overproduction of PBHs. No PBH overproduction requires $w\gtrsim0.42$ up to 2-$σ$ level for the monochromatic spectrum. Furthermore, including bounds from the cosmic microwave background, we find in general that the mass range of the PBH counterpart is bounded by $10^{-5} M_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim10^{-1} M_\odot$. Lastly, we find that the PTA signal can explain the microlensing events reported by OGLE for $0.42\lesssim w\lesssim 0.50$.

Low Depth Virtual Distillation of Quantum Circuits by Deterministic Circuit Decomposition,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18874v1,"Akib Karim, Shaobo Zhang, Muhammad Usman","Virtual distillation (VD) using measurements of multiple copies of a quantum circuit have recently been proposed as a method of noise mitigation of expectation values. Circuit decompositions known as B gates were found only for single qubit expectation values however practical calculations require multi-qubit expectation values which cannot be corrected with B gates. We discover low depth circuit decompositions for multi-qubit expectation values by combining multiple projections to recover the correct measurement statistics or expectation values. Our method adds linear entangling gates with number of qubits, but requires extra measurements. Furthermore, in applications to find ground states such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, the variational principle is required which states the energy cannot go below the ground state energy. We discover that the variational principle is violated if noise is higher on single expectation values than multi-qubit which renders VQE useless. We show this occurs when using B gates and is preserved if using our low depth decomposition on all expectation values. We perform demonstration on real devices and demonstrate our decomposition can mitigate real experimental noise in VQE for the H$_2$ molecule with a two qubit tapered mapping, H$_3$ with three qubits, and H$_2$ with four qubits. Our decomposition provides a way to perform duplicate circuit virtual distillation on real devices at significantly lower depth and for arbitrary observables.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Partial Tidal Disruption Events by Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Supermassive and Intermediate-mass Black Hole Binaries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18812v1,"Xiao-Jun Wu, Ye-Fei Yuan, Yan Luo, Wenbin Lin","In the centers of galaxies, stars that orbit supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) can undergo tidal disruptions due to the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. Nevertheless, most previous researches have predominantly focused on full tidal disruption events (FTDEs). In this study, we employ N-body simulations to investigate partial tidal disruption events (PTDEs) induced by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in SMBH-IMBH binaries, taking into account consideration the IMBH's mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity of the outer orbit. Our findings indicate that, in comparison to FTDEs, the majority of tidal disruption events are actually PTDEs. Furthermore, we find that a significant number of stars experiencing partial disruption ultimately get captured by the IMBH, potentially leading to repeating flares. By comparing the period of the periodic eruptions observed in ASASSN-14ko, we find that PTDEs in a specific SMBH-IMBH binary system can align with the observed period if the SMBH has a mass of $10^7\rm{\ M_\odot}$, the IMBH has a mass smaller than approximately $10^5\rm{\ M_\odot}$, the eccentricity of the SMBH-IMBH binary exceeds approximately $0.5$, and the semi-major axis of the SMBH-IMBH binary is larger than approximately $0.001\rm{\ pc}$. Moreover, our model effectively accounts for the observed period derivative for ASASSN-14ko ($\dot{P}=-0.0026\pm 0.0006$), and our results also imply that some quasi-periodic eruptions may be attributed to PTDEs occurring around SMBH-IMBH binaries.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Topological interpretation of extremal and Davies-type phase transitions of black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18791v1,"Krishnakanta Bhattacharya, Kazuharu Bamba, Douglas Singleton","Topological arguments are currently being used as a novel scheme to discern the properties of black holes while ignoring their detailed structure and specific field equations. Among various avenues of black hole physics, where this novel approach is being utilized, the phase transition in black hole thermodynamics lies at the forefront. There are several types of phase transition in black holes; such as the van der Waals type phase transition, Davies-type phase transition, extremal phase transition, and Hawking-Page (HP) transition. So far, the topological interpretation, where the critical point has been identified with the non-zero topological charge, has been obtained only for the van der Waals type phase transition and HP transition in different spacetimes. To complete the picture, here we provide the same interpretation for two other phase transitions: Davies-type phase transition and extremal phase transition. The entire analysis is general and is valid for any spacetime where these types of phase transitions are observed. More importantly, our analysis suggests that amid the apparent differences in these phase transitions, they share the same topological characteristics, \textit{i.e.} non-zero topological charge arising from different thermodynamic potentials in different types of phase transition.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Physical Pathways for JWST-Observed Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18773v1,"Junehyoung Jeon, Volker Bromm, Boyuan Liu, Steven L.

Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds ($\sim10^5-10^6$ M$_\odot$), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model that is set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi-Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultra-deep JWST surveys.",{'black holes': 3},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Conversely, when a particle starts the quantum walk from the lattice bulk, we observe the bulk walker being repelled from the edge, especially in the presence of strong hopping modulation. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum walk of two particles with nearest-neighbor interaction, emphasizing the repulsion between edge and bulk walkers caused by the interaction. Also, we explore the dynamics of two interacting particles in the lattice bulk and find interesting bulk localization through the formation of bound states influenced by the combined effect of hopping modulation and nearest-neighbor interaction.

Primordial black holes or else? Tidal tests on subsolar mass gravitational-wave observations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18656v1,"F. Crescimbeni, G. Franciolini, P. Pani, A. Riotto","The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as one of the smoking gun signatures of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs). We critically assess whether these systems could be distinguished from stellar binaries, for example composed of white dwarfs or neutron stars, which could also populate the subsolar mass range. At variance with PBHs, the gravitational-wave signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which dramatically grow for moderately compact stars as those expected in the subsolar range. We forecast the capability of constraining tidal effects of putative subsolar neutron star binaries with current and future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivities as well as next-generation experiments. We show that, should LVK O4 run observe subsolar neutron-star mergers, it could measure the (large) tidal effects with high significance. In particular, for subsolar neutron-star binaries, O4 and O5 projected sensitivities would allow measuring the effect of tidal disruption on the waveform in a large portion of the parameter space, also constraining the tidal deformability at ${\cal O}(10\%)$ level, thus excluding a primordial origin of the binary. Viceversa, for subsolar PBH binaries, model-agnostic upper bounds on the tidal deformability can rule out neutron stars or more exotic competitors. Assuming events similar to the sub-threshold candidate SSM200308 reported in LVK O3b data are PBH binaries, O4 projected sensitivity would allow ruling out the presence of neutron-star tidal effects at $\approx 3 σ$ C.L., thus strengthening the PBH hypothesis.

GN42437 has a low-metallicity (5-10% Z$_\odot$) and its rest-frame H$α$ equivalent width suggests nearly all of the observed stellar mass formed within the last 3 Myr. GN42437 has an extraordinary 7$σ$ significant [Ne V] 3427 $\mathring{\rm A}$ detection.

The approach uses hybrid classical/quantum hardware that is well suited for quantum computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport equations for a scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions.

Negative Temperature Pressure in Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18570v1,Richard A.

For decades negative temperatures have been shown in a number of spin systems, but experiments only recently demonstrated atomic ensembles with negative temperatures in their motional degrees of freedom. An observed behavior of such negative temperature ensembles is that despite highly attractive forces between an arbitrary number of particles, there is a self-stabilization against collapse. Negative temperatures are only possible in quantum systems because there exists upper bounds on the energy of particles -- a property not found in classical physics. Here we consider whether event horizons set up similar upper limits within black holes, giving rise to negative temperature systems just within event horizons.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the gold standard classical algorithm for predicting these properties, but relies on approximations of the unknown universal functional, limiting its general applicability for many fundamental and technologically relevant systems. In this work we develop a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm called quantum enhanced DFT (QEDFT) that systematically constructs quantum approximations of the universal functional using data obtained from a quantum computer.
  We benchmark the QEDFT algorithm on the Fermi-Hubbard model, both numerically and on data from experiments on real quantum hardware.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that QEDFT works even when only noisy, low-depth quantum computation is available, by benchmarking the algorithm on data obtained from Google's quantum computer.
  We further show how QEDFT also captures quintessential properties of strongly correlated Mott physics for large Fermi-Hubbard systems using functionals generated on much smaller system sizes.

To further understand the limitations of the conformal flatness approximation, in this work, we construct spatially-conformally-flat hot hypermassive neutron stars with postmerger-like rotation laws, and perform conformally flat evolutions and analysis over dynamical timescales. We found that the stellar profiles of quasi-toroidal models with high angular momentum for $J \gtrsim 9 \;G M_{\odot}^2 / c$ can change significantly over dynamical timescales.

We find that, in general, the breaking of Diff invariance makes the electric and magnetic parts of the vector field to gravitate in a different way. In the sub-Hubble regime we recover the standard radiation-like behaviour of the energy density, however in the super-Hubble regime the behaviour is totally different to the Diff case, thus opening up a wide range of possibilities for cosmological model building. In particular, possible effects on the evolution of large-scale primordial magnetic fields are discussed.",{'geodesics': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Unveiling NPT bound problem: From Distillability Sets to Inequalities and Multivariable Insights,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18037v1,"Si-Yuan Qi, Geni Gupur, Yu-Chun Wu, Guo-Ping Guo","Equivalence between Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) entanglement and bound entanglement is a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory. So far limited progress has been made, even on the seemingly simple case of Werner states bound entanglement. The primary challenge is to give a concise mathematical representation of undistillability. To this end, we propose a decomposition of the N-undistillability verification into $log(N)$ repeated steps of 1-undistillability verification. For Werner state N-undistillability verification, a bound for N-undistillability is given, which is independent of the dimensionality of Werner states. Equivalent forms of inequalities for both rank one and two matrices are presented, before transforming the two-undistillability case into a matrix analysis problem. A new perspective is also attempted by seeing it as a non-convex multi-variable function, proving its critical points and conjecturing Hessian positivity, which would make them local minimums.",{'quantum information theory': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
A linear photonic swap test circuit for quantum kernel estimation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17923v1,"Alessio Baldazzi, Nicolò Leone, Matteo Sanna, Stefano Azzini, Lorenzo Pavesi","Among supervised learning models, Support Vector Machine stands out as one of the most robust and efficient models for classifying data clusters. At the core of this method, a kernel function is employed to calculate the distance between different elements of the dataset, allowing for their classification. Since every kernel function can be expressed as a scalar product, we can estimate it using Quantum Mechanics, where probability amplitudes and scalar products are fundamental objects. The swap test, indeed, is a quantum algorithm capable of computing the scalar product of two arbitrary wavefunctions, potentially enabling a quantum speed-up. Here, we present an integrated photonic circuit designed to implement the swap test algorithm. Our approach relies solely on linear optical integrated components and qudits, represented by single photons from an attenuated laser beam propagating through a set of waveguides. By utilizing 2$^3$ spatial degrees of freedom for the qudits, we can configure all the necessary arrangements to set any two-qubits state and perform the swap test. This simplifies the requirements on the circuitry elements and eliminates the need for non-linearity, heralding, or post-selection to achieve multi-qubits gates. Our photonic swap test circuit successfully encodes two qubits and estimates their scalar product with a measured root mean square error smaller than 0.05. This result paves the way for the development of integrated photonic architectures capable of performing Quantum Machine Learning tasks with robust devices operating at room temperature.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Demonstration of Robust and Efficient Quantum Property Learning with Shallow Shadows,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17911v1,"Hong-Ye Hu, Andi Gu, Swarnadeep Majumder, Hang Ren, Yipei Zhang, Derek S. Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zlatko Minev, Susanne F. Yelin, Alireza Seif","Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the robust shallow shadows protocol. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The DM halo density profiles generate appropriate shape functions under the linear model that satisfy all the essential conditions for presenting the wormhole geometries. Apart from that, we take into account an embedded wormhole-specific shape function to inspect DM profiles under the non-linear model. We noticed that the null energy conditions are violated by the obtained solution from each model, which confirms that the DM support wormholes to sustain in the galactic halo.

Quantum Circuit Discovery for Fault-Tolerant Logical State Preparation with Reinforcement Learning,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17761v1,"Remmy Zen, Jan Olle, Luis Colmenarez, Matteo Puviani, Markus Müller, Florian Marquardt","One of the key aspects in the realization of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers is quantum error correction (QEC). The first essential step of QEC is to encode the logical state into physical qubits in a fault-tolerant manner. Recently, flag-based protocols have been introduced that use ancillary qubits to flag harmful errors. However, there is no clear recipe for finding a compact quantum circuit with flag-based protocols for fault-tolerant logical state preparation. It is even more difficult when we consider the hardware constraints, such as qubit connectivity and gate set. In this work, we propose and explore reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically discover compact and hardware-adapted quantum circuits that fault-tolerantly prepare the logical state of a QEC code. We show that RL discovers circuits with fewer gates and ancillary qubits than published results without and with hardware constraints of up to 15 physical qubits. Furthermore, RL allows for straightforward exploration of different qubit connectivities and the use of transfer learning to accelerate the discovery. More generally, our work opens the door towards the use of RL for the discovery of fault-tolerant quantum circuits for addressing tasks beyond state preparation, including magic state preparation, logical gate synthesis, or syndrome measurement.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Learning to Program Variational Quantum Circuits with Fast Weights,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17760v1,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,"Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has surfaced as a pioneering framework addressing sequential control tasks and time-series modeling. It has demonstrated empirical quantum advantages notably within domains such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and time-series prediction. A significant advancement lies in Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), specifically tailored for memory-intensive tasks encompassing partially observable environments and non-linear time-series prediction. Nevertheless, QRNN-based models encounter challenges, notably prolonged training duration stemming from the necessity to compute quantum gradients using backpropagation-through-time (BPTT). This predicament exacerbates when executing the complete model on quantum devices, primarily due to the substantial demand for circuit evaluation arising from the parameter-shift rule. This paper introduces the Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP) as a solution to the temporal or sequential learning challenge. The QFWP leverages a classical neural network (referred to as the 'slow programmer') functioning as a quantum programmer to swiftly modify the parameters of a variational quantum circuit (termed the 'fast programmer'). Instead of completely overwriting the fast programmer at each time-step, the slow programmer generates parameter changes or updates for the quantum circuit parameters. This approach enables the fast programmer to incorporate past observations or information. Notably, the proposed QFWP model achieves learning of temporal dependencies without necessitating the use of quantum recurrent neural networks. Numerical simulations conducted in this study showcase the efficacy of the proposed QFWP model in both time-series prediction and RL tasks. The model exhibits performance levels either comparable to or surpassing those achieved by QLSTM-based models.","{'quantum circuit': 2, 'quantum machine learning': 1}",02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17623v1,"Leonardo Biagetti, Vincenzo Alba","Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are ""liberated"" after the ""evaporation"" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-Néel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p<4$, only bound states with $n>p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

It is well known that the violation of the energy condition (EC) of matter leads to various physical problems. To address this issue, researchers have turned their attention to exploring modified theories of gravity, aiming to avoid the violation of ECs by introducing geometric terms. In this paper, within the framework of the $f(Q)$ modified gravitational theory, we investigate the effectiveness of ECs for matter in traversable wormholes. We examine the compliance of four types of energy conditions (weak energy condition, null energy condition, dominant energy condition, and strong energy condition) in the model by selecting a power-law model for $f(Q)$ and considering different shape functions $b(r)$. Our study reveals that for traversable wormholes realized through the $f(Q)$ modified gravity theory using the power-law model $f(Q)=a(-Q)^n$, all four types of ECs for matter can be satisfied.

We propose a warm-starting technique, that utilizes an approximation to generate beneficial initial parameter values for the VQE aiming to mitigate these effects. The warm-start is based on Approximate Complex Amplitude Encoding, a VQA using fidelity estimations from classical shadows to encode complex amplitude vectors into quantum states.

We use functions of η1(z) = 1 + η0z and η2(z) = 1 + η0z=(1 + z) to parameterize the deviation of CDDR. By reparameterizing the SLGW waveform with CDDR and the distance-redshift relation, we include the deviation parameters η0 of CDDR as waveform parameters. We evaluate the ability of this method by calculating the parameter estimation of simulated SLGW signals from massive binary black holes. We apply the Fisher information matrix and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to calculate parameter estimation.

Eccentric Mergers in AGN Discs: Influence of the Supermassive Black-Hole on Three-body Interactions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16948v1,"Gaia Fabj, Johan Samsing","There are indications that stellar-origin black holes (BHs) are efficiently paired up in binary black holes (BBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disc environments, which can undergo interactions with single BHs in the disc. Such binary-single interactions can potentially lead to an exceptionally high fraction of gravitational-wave mergers with measurable eccentricity in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. We here take the next important step in this line of studies, by performing post-Newtonian N-body simulations between migrating BBHs and single BHs set in an AGN disc-like configuration with a consistent inclusion of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the equations of motion. With this setup, we study how the fraction of eccentric mergers varies in terms of the initial size of the BBH semi-major axis relative to the Hill sphere, as well as how it depends on the angle between the BBH and the incoming single BH. We find that the fraction of eccentric mergers is still relatively large, even when the interactions are notably influenced by the gravitational field of the nearby SMBH. However, the fraction as a function of the BBH semi-major axis does not follow a smooth functional shape, but instead shows strongly varying features that originate from the underlying phase-space structure. The phase-space further reveals that many of the eccentric mergers are formed through prompt scatterings. Finally, we present the first analytical solution to how the presence of an SMBH in terms of its Hill sphere affects the probability for forming eccentric BBH mergers through chaotic three-body interactions.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Depending on the source, the configuration of the field lines may differ significantly, affecting the trajectories of charged particles and the corresponding observables. Usually, the magnetic fields around black holes are modeled within a single source or current generating the field. However, magnetic fields can have more than a single origin, being a combination of different fields, such as, e.g., that of an accretion disk and external large-scale or Galactic ones. In this paper, we propose a combined magnetic field solution given by the superposition of the uniform and Blandford-Znajek split-monopole magnetic fields in a strong gravity regime of the Schwarzschild black hole. We show that when the combined magnetic field components are aligned, the resulting field is of a paraboloidal jetlike shape. Such a configuration is supported by relativistic jet observations and is often utilized in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations. In the opposite orientation of the two field components, we observe looplike field structures magnetically connecting the black hole with an accretion disk and the magnetic null points, which can be related to the regions of magnetic reconnection. In the combined magnetic field configurations, we analyze the dynamics of charged particles, study their stability conditions, and find the locations of stable off-equatorial structures close to the symmetry axis. We consider an ionization of Keplerian accretion disk as a particular scenario of particle scattering.

In this paper, we explore the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in the context of rotating hairy black holes, aiming to understand the impact of hairiness on the conjecture for Kerr black holes. We investigate whether TEH of rotating hairy black holes can be disrupted by incoming test particles and scalar fields. When test particles and scalar fields incident on the rotating hairy black hole are found. In extreme cases, when considering a second order approximation, if the parameter $κ$ (The parameter here is a function related to hair strength $κ(Q_m^{2k})$.)falls within the range of $0<κ<\sqrt{1/3}$, TEH of a hairy black hole can be disrupted. Conversely, in the range of $\sqrt{1/3}<κ<1$, TEH of a hairy black hole cannot be disrupted. When considering the second order approximation in near extreme cases, the parameter $κ$, within the range of $0<κ<1$, can lead to the disruption of TEH in this spacetime. When an incident scalar field is present, in near extreme conditions, TEH of a rotating short hair black hole cannot be disrupted. Therefore, the value of the parameter $κ$ reveals the connection between rotating short hair black holes and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, indicating that the presence of short hair significantly affects TEH of black holes.

Lower bound for large midpoint transversal fluctuations in the corner growth model,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16332v1,Xiao Shen,"The study of transversal fluctuation of the optimal path has been a crucial aspect of the KPZ universality class. In this paper, we establish the first probability lower bound, with optimal exponential order, for the rare event in which the midpoint (or any fixed level) of the geodesic has a large transversal fluctuation. We present our result in the setting of the corner growth model, which is also known as the exponential last-passage percolation. The previously known lower bounds hold for the maximum transversal fluctuation along the entire geodesic (Hammond-Sarkar'20) or the starting portion of the geodesic at a local scale (Agarwal'23). Our result improves upon these as now the rare event can demand where the large fluctuation occurs exactly along the geodesic, on both local and global scales. This fills the final missing piece in the literature on the tail bounds for the transversal fluctuation of geodesics. Our proof utilizes the coupling method: we first obtain a version of the estimate for the semi-infinite geodesic using duality and then transfer the result to finite geodesics using path monotonicity. Our method differs from the previous works (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20), and in fact, we do not require fine information about the left tail moderate deviation of the last-passage time, which played a crucial role in (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20).",{'geodesics': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Computation of marginal eigenvalue distributions in the Laguerre and Jacobi $β$ ensembles,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16069v1,"Peter J.

In the case $β=1$ this is a question of long standing in the mathematical statistics literature. A recursive procedure to accomplish this task is given for $β$ a positive integer, and the parameter $λ_1$ a non-negative integer. This case is special due to a finite basis of elementary functions, with coefficients which are polynomials. In the Laguerre case with $β= 1$ and $λ_1 + 1/2$ a non-negative integer some evidence is given of their again being a finite basis, now consisting of elementary functions and the error function multiplied by elementary functions. Moreover, from this the corresponding distributions in the fixed trace case permit a finite basis of power functions, as also for $λ_1$ a non-negative integer. The fixed trace case in this setting is relevant to quantum information theory and quantum transport problem, allowing particularly the exact determination of Landauer conductance distributions in a previously intractable parameter regime.

In this paper we used the recently developed Barrow BH model to calculate the addition to the area of the event horizon of his toy model by using the Landauer concept. Besides we make this computation considering $Δ$ as a constant and a variable parameter. We formulate the Barrow parameter ($Δ$) as a function of the energy/mass, which is new in the Barrow BH literature. We will investigate the differences between the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy ($Δ=0$) and the fractal ($Δ=1$) cases concerning the addition in the area of the BH.

To this end, the first hitting time statistics is recorded using unitary dynamics interspersed stroboscopically by measurements, which is implemented on IBM quantum computers with a midcircuit readout option. Unlike classical hitting times, the statistical aspect of the problem depends on the way we construct the measured path, an effect that we quantify experimentally. First, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction that the mean return time to a target state is quantized, with abrupt discontinuities found for specific sampling times and other control parameters, which has a well-known topological interpretation. Second, depending on the initial state, system parameters, and measurement protocol, the detection probability can be less than one or even zero, which is related to dark-state physics. Both, return-time quantization and the appearance of the dark states are related to degeneracies in the eigenvalues of the unitary time evolution operator. We conclude that, for the IBM quantum computer under study, the first hitting times of monitored quantum walks are resilient to noise. Yet, finite resolution effects lead to new topological, chirality, and broadening effects, which disappear in the asymptotic theory with an infinite number of measurements.

Entanglement islands and cutoff branes from path-integral optimization,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15836v1,"Ashish Chandra, Zhengjiang Li, Qiang Wen","Recently it was proposed that, the AdS/BCFT correspondence can be simulated by a holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$, where the cut-off brane plays the role of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane \cite{Basu:2022crn}. In this paper, we focus on the Weyl transformation that optimizes the path integral computation of the reduced density matrix for a single interval in a holographic CFT$_2$. When we take the limit that one of the endpoint of the interval goes to infinity (a half line), such a holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ matches the AdS/BCFT configuration for a BCFT with one boundary. Without taking the limit, the induced cutoff brane becomes a circle passing through the two endpoints of the interval. We assume that the cutoff brane also plays the same role as the KR brane in AdS/BCFT, hence the path-integral-optimized purification for the interval is in the island phase. This explains the appearance of negative mutual information observed in \cite{Camargo:2022mme}. We check that, the entanglement entropy and the balanced partial entanglement entropy (BPE) calculated via the island formulas, exactly match with the RT formula and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), which are allowed to anchor on the cutoff brane.",{'RT formula': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Holography']

Tidal Disruption Encores,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15590v2,"Taeho Ryu, Rosalba Perna, Matteo Cantiello","Nuclear star clusters (NSCs), made up of a dense concentrations of stars and the compact objects they leave behind, are ubiquitous in the central regions of galaxies, surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Close interactions between stars and stellar-mass black holes (sBH) lead to tidal disruption events (TDEs). We uncover an interesting new phenomenon: For a subset of these, the unbound debris (to the sBH) remain bound to the SMBH, accreting at a later time, and thus giving rise to a second flare. We compute the rate of such events, and find them ranging within $10^{-6}$ -$10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$gal$^{-1}$ for SMBH mass $\simeq 10^{6}-10^{9}M_\odot$. Time delays between the two flares spread over a wide range, from less than a year to hundreds of years. The temporal evolution of the light curves of the second flare can vary between the standard $t^{-5/3}$ power-law to much steeper decays, providing a natural explanation for observed light curves in tension with the classical TDE model. Our predictions have implications for learning about NSC properties and calibrating its sBH population. Some double flares may be electromagnetic counterparts to LISA Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral (EMRI) sources. Another important implication is the possible existence of TDE-like events in very massive SMBHs, where TDEs are not expected.

The calculated lower bounds via the linear dynamical systems L_{\frac{\partial}{\partialθ}}, L_{\frac{\partial}{\partial r}}, and L_{\frac{\partial}{\partialφ}} are -\ln2+\ln|(\dot{R}B)^{2}-(R')^{2}|-2\ln|B|, 2\ln|\dot{B}|-\ln2 and -\ln2-2\ln|B|+\ln|(\dot{R}^{2}B^{2}-R'^{2})\sin^{2}θ-B^{2}\cos^{2}θ| respectively. We also show that the sensitivities and the lower sensitivities via L_{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}} are zero. In the quantum framework we analyse the properties of the Einstein-Vaz shells which are the final result of the quantum gravitational collapse arising from the Lemaitre Tolman Bondi discussed by Vaz in 2014. In fact, Vaz showed that continued collapse to a singularity can only be obtained if one combines two independent and entire solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Forbidding such a combinatin leads naturally to matter condensing on the Schwarzschild surface during quantum collapse. In that way, an entirely new framework for black holes (BHs) has emerged. The approach of Vaz as also consistent with Einstein's idea in 1939 of the localization of the collapsing particles within a thin spherical shell. Here, following an approach of oned of us (CC), we derive the BH mass and energy spectra via a Schrodinger-like approach, by further supporting Vaz's conclusions that instead of a spacetime singularity covered by an event horizon, the final result of the gravitational collapse is an essentially quantum object, an extremely compact ""dark star"". This ""gravitational atom"" is held up not by any degeneracy pressure but by quantum gravity in the same way that ordinary atoms are sustained by quantum mechanics.

Probing black hole `charge&#39; from the binary black hole inspiral,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15336v1,"N. V. Krishnendu, Sumanta Chakraborty","Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations have enabled us to look beyond the standard paradigm of gravitational physics, namely general relativity (GR). Along with the mass and the angular momentum, which typical astrophysical black holes (BHs) are endowed with, theories beyond GR generically induce `charge' to these BHs. Notably, for BHs carrying the extra `charge' hair, we expect the BH absorption effects to modify accordingly and alter the tidal heating terms. Hence, the inclusion of the corrections in the GW waveform model, arising from the BH `charge', allows us to test the consistency of the observed binaries with Kerr BHs in GR. We compute the explicit dependence of the binary inspiral phase on the `charge' parameter arising from the tidal heating effect and study the measurability of the same from GW observations of binary mergers. Specifically, we employ the {\tt TaylorF2} waveform model, which accurately models the inspiral evolution of an aligned-spin binary merger, and Bayesian analysis-based GW data inference to measure the `charge' parameter for a selected set of detected binaries. We also present a detailed simulation study to investigate the possibility of measuring the charge parameter from binaries with different masses, spins and source locations. The analysis of selected GW events from the third GW transient catalogue shows that the `charge' parameter constraints are poor from the observed signals with the current sensitivity. In contrast, the simulation studies indicate that the spinning binaries with significant mass asymmetry provide the best constraints on the BH `charge' parameter. Finally, we study the prospects of measuring the BH `charge' parameter from a future GW detector with improved sensitivity.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Moreover, as the available qubits increase, the computational complexity grows exponentially, posing additional challenges. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use qubits efficiently and mitigate both present limitations and future complexities.

Spin Doctors: How to diagnose a hierarchical merger origin,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15066v1,"Ethan Payne, Kyle Kremer, Michael Zevin","Gravitational-wave observations provide the unique opportunity of studying black hole formation channels and histories -- but only if we can identify their origin. One such formation mechanism is the dynamical synthesis of black hole binaries in dense stellar systems. Given the expected isotropic distribution of component spins of binary black hole in gas-free dynamical environments, the presence of anti-aligned or in-plane spins with respect to the orbital angular momentum is considered a tell-tale sign of a merger's dynamical origin. Even in the scenario where birth spins of black holes are low, hierarchical mergers attain large component spins due to the orbital angular momentum of the prior merger. However, measuring such spin configurations is difficult. Here, we quantify the efficacy of the spin parameters encoding aligned-spin ($\chieff$) and in-plane spin ($\chip$) at classifying such hierarchical systems. Using Monte Carlo cluster simulations to generate a realistic distribution of hierarchical merger parameters from globular clusters, we can infer mergers' $\chieff$ and $\chip$. The cluster populations are simulated using Advanced LIGO-Virgo sensitivity during the detector network's third observing period and projections for design sensitivity. Using a ""likelihood-ratio""-based statistic, we find that $\sim2\%$ of the recovered population by the current gravitational-wave detector network has a statistically significant $\chip$ measurement, whereas no $\chieff$ measurement was capable of confidently determining a system to be anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum at current detector sensitivities. These results indicate that measuring spin-precession through $\chip$ is a more detectable signature of a hierarchical mergers and dynamical formation than anti-aligned spins.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The influence of these two parameters on the ergoregion, circular geodesics in the equatorial plane, and energy extraction from the KRZ black holes through magnetic reconnection is carefully analyzed. Results indicate that deviations from the Kerr metric have a notable influence on the energy extraction process. Particularly, energy extraction is enhanced with more negative ${δ_1}$ or more positive ${δ_2}$ within the range constrained by current astronomical observations, resulting in significantly higher maximum power and efficiency compared to the Kerr model. Moreover, when ${δ_2}$ is sufficiently negative, extracting energy through this mechanism becomes increasingly challenging, necessitating an exceptionally high black hole spin.","{'black holes': 3, 'geodesics': 1}",02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

We further argue that when specific decoders -- such as minimum-weight perfect matching -- are applied to recover this information, an error-correcting threshold is generically encountered within the gapped phase. In cases where the adiabatic evolution is known, we explicitly show examples in which quantum information can be recovered by using stabilizer measurements and Pauli feedback, even up to a phase boundary, though the resulting decoding transitions are in different universality classes from the optimal decoding transitions in the presence of incoherent Pauli noise.

"Birth of Rapidly Spinning, Overmassive Black Holes in the Early Universe",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14706v1,"Kohei Inayoshi, Kohei Ichikawa","The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled numerous massive black holes (BHs) in faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The discovery highlights the presence of dust-reddened AGN populations, referred to as little red dots (LRDs), more abundant than X-ray selected AGNs, which are less influenced by obscuration. This finding indicates that the cosmic growth rate of BHs within this population does not decrease but rather increases at higher redshifts beyond $z\sim 6$. The BH accretion rate density deduced from their luminosity function is remarkably higher than that from other AGN surveys in X-ray and infrared bands. To align the cumulative mass density accreted to BHs with the observed BH mass density at $z\simeq 4-5$, as derived from the integration of the BH mass function, the radiative efficiency must be doubled from the canonical 10% value, achieving significance beyond the $>2σ$ confidence level. This suggests the presence of rapid spins with 96% of the maximum limit among these BHs, maintained by prolonged mass accretion instead of chaotic accretion with randomly oriented inflows. Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the stellar mass of galaxies hosting these LRDs, ensuring consistency with galaxy formation in the standard cosmological model, where the host stellar mass is limited by the available baryonic reservoir. Our analysis gives a lower bound for the BH-to-galaxy mass ratio that exceeds the typical value known in the nearby universe and aligns with that for JWST-detected unobscured AGNs. Accordingly, we propose a hypothesis that the dense, dust-rich environments within LRDs facilitate the emergence of rapidly spinning and overmassive BH populations during the epoch of reionization. This scenario predicts a potential association between relativistic jets and other high-energy phenomena with overmassive BHs in the early universe.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Useful variants and perturbations of completely entangled subspaces and spans of unextendible product bases,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14697v1,"Ritabrata Sengupta, Ajit Iqbal Singh","Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well studied in the literature, namely the unextendable product basis by Bennett et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4 (2004)]. More recently Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev.

We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendable product basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain UPB's, their orthogonal complements, and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces.

Quantum computing utilizes particles governed by quantum mechanics for computational purposes, leveraging properties like superposition and entanglement for information representation and manipulation. Quantum machine learning applies these principles to enhance classical machine learning models, potentially reducing network size and training time on quantum hardware. The paper covers basic quantum mechanics principles, including superposition, phase space, and entanglement, and introduces the concept of quantum gates that exploit these properties. It also reviews classical deep learning concepts, such as artificial neural networks, gradient descent, and backpropagation, before delving into trainable quantum circuits as neural networks.

Dynamical quantum maps for single-qubit gates under non-Markovian phase noise,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14530v1,"J. M. Sánchez Velázquez, A. Steiner, R. Freund, M. Guevara-Bertsch, Ch. D. Marciniak, T. Monz, A. Bermudez","Noise is both ubiquitous and generally deleterious in settings where precision is required. This is especially true in the quantum technology sector where system utility typically decays rapidly under its influence. Understanding the noise in quantum devices is thus a prerequisite for efficient strategies to mitigate or even eliminate its harmful effects. However, this requires resources that are often prohibitive, such that the typically-used noise models rely on simplifications that sometimes depart from experimental reality. Here we derive a compact microscopic error model for single-qubit gates that only requires a single experimental input - the noise power spectral density. Our model goes beyond standard depolarizing or Pauli-twirled noise models, explicitly including non-Clifford and non-Markovian contributions to the dynamical error map. We gauge our predictions for experimentally relevant metrics against established characterization techniques run on a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we find that experimental estimates of average gate errors measured through randomized benchmarking and reconstructed via quantum process tomography are tightly lower-bounded by our analytical estimates, while the depolarizing model overestimates the gate error. Our noise modeling including non-Markovian contributions can be readily applied to established frameworks such as dynamical decoupling and dynamically-corrected gates, or to provide more realistic thresholds for quantum error correction.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Spectral invariance and maximality properties of the frequency spectrum of quantum neural networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14515v2,"Patrick Holzer, Ivica Turkalj","Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a popular approach in Quantum Machine Learning due to their close connection to Variational Quantum Circuits, making them a promising candidate for practical applications on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A QNN can be expressed as a finite Fourier series, where the set of frequencies is called the frequency spectrum. We analyse this frequency spectrum and prove, for a large class of models, various maximality results. Furthermore, we prove that under some mild conditions there exists a bijection between classes of models with the same area $A = RL$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A = RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with arbitrarily many layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. If the generators of the QNN can be further decomposed into 2-dimensional sub-generators, then this specification follows from elementary number-theoretical considerations. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, we extend existing results based on the so-called Golomb ruler and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Quantum computers offer a promising alternative for solving these equations, as they can simulate larger and more complex systems more efficiently both in time and resources. In this paper we investigate the potential of using the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) algorithm on near-term quantum hardware to solve for the Maxwells equations. Our objective is to analyze the trade-off between the accuracy of the simulated fields and the depth of the quantum circuit required to implement the VarQITE algorithm. We demonstrate that VarQITE can efficiently approximate the solution of these equations with high accuracy, and show that its performance can be enhanced by optimizing the quantum circuit depth.

Among 601 bright AGN with 0.2-5 keV counts of greater than 100, 83 sources (~14%) are classified as steep-spectrum sources. These sources have typical 0.5-2 keV luminosities of L(SX) ~ 1e44 erg/s and the majority of them are found at redshifts below z=1. In comparison with sources with flatter spectra, these sources have, on average, a UV (or optical) to 2 keV luminosity ratio that is larger by ~0.3 dex and bluer optical-to-UV continuum emission. They also appear to be radio quiet based on the detection rate in the FIRST and VLASS surveys. Their host galaxies -- at least in the redshift range of z=0.2-0.8, where the AGN-galaxy decomposition results from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging are available -- tend to be late-type and have smaller stellar masses than those of sources with flatter spectra. These properties are similar to those found in nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, in agreement with the picture that they are AGN with elevated accretion rates and are in the early growth phase of black hole and galaxy co-evolution. However, the steep-spectrum sources are not exclusively narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies; indeed many are broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, as found by a catalogue search. This suggests that these steep-spectrum sources may be black holes generally with high accretion rates but of a wide mass range, including a few objects emitting at L(SX)>1e45 erg/s, of which black hole masses can be close to 10^9 M_sun.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
The origin of the Slow-to-Alfvén Wave Cascade Power Ratio and its Implications for Particle Heating in Accretion Flows,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14089v1,"Kaushik Satapathy, Dimitrios Psaltis, Feryal Özel","The partition of turbulent heating between ions and electrons in radiatively inefficient accretion flows plays a crucial role in determining the observational appearance of accreting black holes. Modeling this partition is, however, a challenging problem because of the large scale separation between the macroscopic scales at which energy is injected by turbulence and the microscopic ones at which it is dissipated into heat. Recent studies of particle heating from collisionless damping of turbulent energy have shown that the partition of energy between ions and electrons is dictated by the ratio of the energy injected into the slow and Alfvén wave cascades as well as the plasma $β$ parameter. In this paper, we study the mechanism of the injection of turbulent energy into slow- and Alfvén- wave cascades in magnetized shear flows. We show that this ratio depends on the particular ($rφ$) components of the Maxwell and Reynolds stress tensors that cause the transport of angular momentum, the shearing rate, and the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shear. We then use numerical magnetohydrodynamic shearing-box simulations with background conditions relevant to black hole accretion disks to compute the magnitudes of the stress tensors for turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability and derive the injection power ratio between slow and Alfvén wave cascades. We use these results to formulate a local subgrid model for the ion-to-electron heating ratio that depends on the macroscopic characteristics of the accretion flow.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
New Mass Window for Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter from Memory Burden Effect,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14069v1,"Ana Alexandre, Gia Dvali, Emmanouil Koutsangelas","The mass ranges allowed for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to constitute all of Dark Matter (DM) are broadly constrained. However, these constraints rely on the standard semiclassical approximation which assumes that the evaporation process is self-similar. Quantum effects such as memory burden take the evaporation process out of the semiclassical regime latest by half-decay time. What happens beyond this time is currently not known. However, theoretical evidence based on prototype models indicates that the evaporation slows down thereby extending the lifetime of a black hole. This modifies the mass ranges constrained, in particular, by BBN and CMB spectral distortions. We show that previous constraints are largely relaxed when the PBH lifetime is extended, making it possible for PBHs to constitute all of DM in previously excluded mass ranges. In particular, this is the case for PBHs lighter than $10^9$g which enter the memory burden stage before BBN and are still present today as DM.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Additionally, we have also calculated dimensionless tidal deformability ($Λ$) in massive gravity. To constrain the allowed values of the parameters appearing in massive gravity, we have imposed the condition $Λ_{1.4 {M}_{\odot }}\lesssim580 $. Notably, in the MNJL model, the value of $α$ varies between zero and one. As $α$ increases, the EOS becomes stiffer, and the value of $Λ$ increases accordingy. We have demonstrated that by softening the EOS with increasing the bag constant, one can obtain objects in massive gravity that not only satisfy the constraint $Λ_{1.4 {M}% _{\odot }}\lesssim580$, but they also fall within the unknown mass gap region ($2.5{M}_{\odot}-5{M}_{\odot }$).

Our constructions incur a constant-factor increase in the quantum circuit depth and a polynomial overhead in the number of qubits: To execute an arbitrary quantum circuit on $n$ qubits, we give a 3D quantum fault-tolerance architecture involving $O(n^{3/2} \log^3 n)$ qubits, and a quasi-2D architecture using $O(n^2 \log^3 n)$ qubits. Applied to recent fault-tolerance constructions, this gives a fault-tolerance threshold theorem for universal quantum computations with local operations, a polynomial qubit overhead and a quasi-polylogarithmic depth overhead.

Radiating particle in the vicinity of the weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13797v1,"Bakhtinur Juraev, Zdeněk Stuchlík, Arman Tursunov, Martin Kološ","It is well known that supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are capable of accelerating charged particles to very high energies. In many cases, the particle acceleration by black holes occurs electromagnetically through an electric field induced by the source. In such scenarios, the accelerated particles radiate electromagnetic waves, leading to the appearance of the backreaction force, which can considerably change the dynamics, especially, if the particles are relativistic. The effect of the radiation reaction force due to accelerating electric field of the central body in curved spacetime has not been considered previously. We study the dynamics of radiating charged particles in the field of the Schwarzschild black hole in the presence of an electric field associated with a small central charge of negligible gravitational influence. We start from the flat spacetime description, solving the Lorentz-Dirac equation reduced to the Landau-Lifshitz form. In curved spacetime, we use the DeWitt-Brehme equation and discuss the effect of the self-force, also known as the tail term, within the given approach. We also study the pure effect of the self-force to calculate the radiative deceleration of radially moving charged particles. In the case of bounded orbits, we find that the radiation reaction force can stabilize and circularize the orbits of oscillating charged particles by suppressing the oscillations or causing the particles to spiral down into the black hole depending on the sign of the electrostatic interaction. In all cases, we calculate the energy losses and exact trajectories of charged particles for different values and signs of electric charge.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Reinforcement learning-assisted quantum architecture search for variational quantum algorithms,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13754v3,Akash Kundu,"A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function. Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem. The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with an $ε$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods we propose in the thesis can be readily adapted to address a wide range of other VQAs.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Then, it is not suitable to describe these systems with equilibrium thermodynamics corresponding to Gibbs-Boltzmann kinetic theory. In the present work, we investigate such thermal systems by using hydrostatic equilibrium thermodynamics. Assuming that the gas between the horizons obeys the Tsallis statistical mechanics, we found that it is possible to obtain the temperature gradient for the classical gas.

Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13271v1,"Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino","In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the Rényi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [1] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

However, given the universality of the gravitational pull, it is expected that dark matter accumulates around astrophysical black holes, which can have an impact in the overall gravitational field, especially at galactic centers, and induce non-negligible effects in their observational imprints. In this work we study the optical appearance of a spherically symmetric black hole both when orbited by isotropically emitting light sources and when surrounded by a (geometrically and optically thin) accretion disk, while immersed in a dark matter halo. The black hole geometry plus the dark matter halo come as a solution of Einstein's field equations coupled to an anisotropic fluid whose density component follows a Hermquist-type distribution. Even in situations in which the geodesic description differs profoundly from the isolated black hole case, we find minor modifications to the primary and secondary tracks of the isotropic orbiting sources, and to the width, location, and relative luminosity of the corresponding photon rings as compared to the Schwarzschild black hole at equal black hole mass and emission models.

Holographic Tests for Giant Graviton Expansion,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12924v1,"Seunggyu Kim, Eunwoo Lee","It has been proposed that the superconformal index admits a novel reformulation, called giant graviton expansion. In this paper, we investigate the properties of dual $AdS_5$ black holes using the giant graviton expansion framework. First, we compute the entropy of black holes in $AdS_5\times S^5$ with fixed charges through a large $N$ saddle point analysis on the giant graviton index and further extremize it in the wrapping number. We identify a specific regime of fugacities where our saddle point analysis is valid. It turns out that this condition ensures the absence of closed-time-like curves and the stability of dual black hole solutions with equal charges. In addition, the giant graviton expansion of the index provides insights into how small black holes in AdS can be interpreted as bound states of branes. We extend our study to include the giant graviton expansion with the insertion of a half-BPS surface defect in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with a $U(N)$ gauge group. Finally, we test the giant graviton expansion in various holographic theories whose dual geometries are $AdS_5\times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_k$ and $AdS_5\times SE_5$.",{'black holes': 3},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

In this picture, the dynamics of the universe's expansion becomes stochastic, and the statistics of the curvature perturbation is encoded in the distribution of the duration of inflation. This provides a non-perturbative framework to study cosmological fluctuations during inflation, which is well-suited to the case of primordial black holes since they originate from large fluctuations.

Several indirect tracers have been explored in the literature, including X/S-shaped radio morphologies and double-peaked (DP) emission lines in the optical spectra. However, the detection rates of confirmed dual AGN candidates from the individual methods remain extremely small. We search for binary black holes in a sample of six sources that exhibit both X-shaped radio morphology and DP emission lines using the VLBA. Three out of the six sources show dual VLBA compact components, making them strong candidates for binary black hole sources. In addition, we present deep uGMRT images revealing the exquisite details of the X-shaped wings in three sources. We present a detailed precession modeling analysis of these sources. The BH separations estimated from the simplistic geodetic precession model are incompatible with those estimated from emission line offsets and the VLBA separations. However, precession induced by a noncoplanar secondary black hole is a feasible mechanism for explaining the observed X-shaped radio morphologies and the black hole separations estimated from other methods. The black hole separations estimated from the double-peaked emission lines agree well with the VLBA compact component separations.

Mestre","The study of the physics of accretion discs developed around the supermassive black hole (BH) candidates are essential theoretical tools to test their nature. Here, we study the accretion flow and associated emission using generalised $α$-discs on to horizonless dark compact objects, in order to compare with the traditional BH scenario. The BH alternative here proposed consists in a dense and highly degenerate core made of fermionic dark matter (DM) which is surrounded by a more diluted DM halo. Such a dense core -- diluted halo DM configuration is a solution of the Einstein equations of General Relativity (GR) in spherical symmetry, which naturally arises once the quantum nature of the DM fermions is dully accounted for. The methodology followed in this work consist in first generalising the theory of $α$-discs to work in the presence of regular and horizonless compact objects, and second, to apply it to the case of core-halo DM profiles typical of active-like galaxies. The fact that the compactness of the dense and transparent DM core scales with the particle mass, allows for the following key findings of this work: (i) it always exist a given core compacity -- i.e., corresponding particle mass -- which produces a luminosity spectrum which is basically indistinguishable from that of a Schwarzschild BH of the same mass as the DM core; (ii) the disc can enter deep inside the non-rotating DM core, allowing for accretion powered efficiencies as high as $28\%$, thus comparable to that of a highly rotating Kerr BH. These results, together with the existence of a critical DM core mass of collapse into a supermassive BH, open new avenues of research for two seemingly unrelated topics such as AGN phenomenology and dark matter physics.",{'einstein equations': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Specifically, by considering the gravitational theory of Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics coupled to a dilaton field with specific coupling functions, we perform an extensive analysis of the characteristics of the black hole, including its geodesics for massive particles, the energy conditions, thermodynamical and stability analysis. The inclusion of a dilaton scalar potential in the action can also give rise to asymptotically (A)dS spacetimes and an effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we find that the black hole can be thermodynamically favored when compared to the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole for those parameters of the model that lead to a larger black-hole horizon for the same mass. Finally, it is observed that the energy conditions of the obtained black hole are indeed satisfied, further validating the robustness of the solution within the theoretical framework, but also implying that this self-gravitating dilaton-non-linear-electrodynamics system constitutes another explicit example of bypassing modern versions of the no-hair theorem without any violation of the energy conditions.",{'geodesics': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The enigmatic, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary HD 5980 A&B has been proposed to have formed through this channel. We investigate this claim by comparing its observed parameters with CHE models. Using MESA, we simulate grids of close massive binaries then use a Bayesian approach to compare them with the stars' observed orbital period, masses, luminosities, and hydrogen surface abundances. The most probable models, given the observational data, have initial periods ~3 days, widening to the present-day ~20 day orbit as a result of mass loss -- correspondingly, they have very high initial stellar masses ($\gtrsim$150 M$_\odot$). We explore variations in stellar wind-mass loss and internal mixing efficiency, and find that models assuming enhanced mass-loss are greatly favored to explain HD 5980, while enhanced mixing is only slightly favoured over our fiducial assumptions. Our most probable models slightly underpredict the hydrogen surface abundances. Regardless of its prior history, this system is a likely binary black hole progenitor. We model its further evolution under our fiducial and enhanced wind assumptions, finding that both stars produce black holes with masses ~19-37 M$_\odot$. The projected final orbit is too wide to merge within a Hubble time through gravitational waves alone. However, the system is thought to be part of a 2+2 hierarchical multiple. We speculate that secular effects with the (possible) third and fourth companions may drive the system to promptly become a gravitational-wave source.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman & Hut (1993) for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most plus least massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide binary formation with super-thermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard binaries form much more rarely, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as $a^3$ for hard and slightly wider binaries. Though mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars -- more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Given the recent significant advancements in post-Minkowskian (PM) theory and gravitational self-force formalism, there is considerable interest in creating waveform models that integrate information from various perturbative methods in innovative ways. This becomes particularly crucial when tackling the accuracy challenge posed by upcoming ground-based detectors (such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and space-based detectors (such as LISA, TianQin or Taiji) expected to operate in the next decade. In this context, we present the derivation of the first spinning EOB Hamiltonian that incorporates PM results up to three-loop order: the SEOB-PM model. The model accounts for the complete hyperbolic motion, encompassing nonlocal-in-time tails. To evaluate its accuracy, we compare its predictions for the conservative scattering angle, augmented with dissipative contributions, against numerical-relativity data of non-spinning and spinning equal-mass black holes. We observe very good agreement, comparable, and in some cases slightly better to the recently proposed $w_{\rm EOB}$-potential model, of which the SEOB-PM model is a resummation around the probe limit. Indeed, in the probe limit, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian and scattering angles reduce to the one of a test mass in Kerr spacetime. Once complemented with nonlocal-in-time contributions for bound orbits, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian can be utilized to generate waveform models for spinning black holes on quasi-circular orbits.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Still, in the simulation of complex structures involving the many-body problem in quantum mechanics, major issues remain about the representation of the system and obtaining results which clearly outperform classical computational devices.

We investigate an explanation for this result in the context of proportionally lower mass black holes in lower mass galaxies compared to higher mass galaxies and differing proportions of emission from AGN and star formation dominating the light at optical and infrared wavelengths as a function of galaxy stellar mass.

The large algebra corresponds to generic values of $γ$, while the small case corresponds to a degeneration limit with $γ\to -\infty$.

MITS: A Quantum Sorcerer Stone For Designing Surface Codes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11027v2,"Avimita Chatterjee, Debarshi Kundu, Swaroop Ghosh","In the evolving landscape of quantum computing, determining the most efficient parameters for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is paramount. Various quantum computers possess varied types and amounts of physical noise. Traditionally, simulators operate in a forward paradigm, taking parameters such as distance, rounds, and physical error to output a logical error rate. However, usage of maximum distance and rounds of the surface code might waste resources. An approach that relies on trial and error to fine-tune QEC code parameters using simulation tools like STIM can be exceedingly time-consuming. Additionally, daily fluctuations in quantum error rates can alter the ideal QEC settings needed. As a result, there is a crucial need for an automated solution that can rapidly determine the appropriate QEC parameters tailored to the current conditions. To bridge this gap, we present MITS, a tool designed to reverse-engineer the well-known simulator STIM for designing QEC codes. MITS accepts the specific noise model of a quantum computer and a target logical error rate as input and outputs the optimal surface code rounds and code distances. This guarantees minimal qubit and gate usage, harmonizing the desired logical error rate with the existing hardware limitations on qubit numbers and gate fidelity.

Could long-period transients be powered by primordial black hole capture?,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11019v1,"Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro","Long-period radio transients have unusual properties that challenge their interpretation as pulsars or magnetars. We examine whether they might instead be powered by primordial black holes (PBHs) making repeated passages through a host star, thereby providing a signature of elusive dark-matter candidates. We demonstrate that constraints derived from the transients' period and period derivative alone already rule out this scenario for most potential host stars.

Merger-Driven Growth of Intermediate-mass Black Holes: Constraints from Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Hyper-luminous X-Ray Sources,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11018v1,"R. Scott Barrows, Mar Mezcua, Julia M. Comerford, Daniel Stern","Hyper-luminous X-ray sources (HLXs) are extragalactic off-nuclear X-ray sources with luminosities exceeding the theoretical limit for accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects. Many HLXs may represent intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) deposited in galaxy halos through mergers, and properties of the stellar cores surrounding HLXs provide powerful constraints on this scenario. Therefore, we have systematically built the largest sample of HLX candidates with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging (24) for the first uniform population study of HLX stellar cores down to low masses. Based on their host galaxy redshifts, at least 21 (88%) have stellar core masses >=10^7 Msun and hence are consistent with accretion onto massive black holes from external galaxies. In 50% of the sample, the HST imaging reveals features connecting the HLXs with their host galaxies, strongly suggesting against the background/foreground contaminant possibility in these cases. Assuming a mass scaling relation for active galactic nuclei and accounting for an estimated contamination fraction of 29%, up to ~60% of our sample may be associated with IMBHs. Similar to previously known HLXs, the X-ray luminosities are systematically elevated relative to their stellar core masses, possibly from merger-driven accretion rate enhancements. The least massive stellar cores are preferentially found at larger nuclear offsets and are more likely to remain wandering in their host galaxy halos. The HLX galaxy occupation fraction is ~10^-2 and has a strong inverse mass dependence. Up to three of the HLX candidates (12%) are potentially consistent with formation within globular clusters or with exceptionally luminous X-ray binaries.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Holographic phenomenology via overlapping degrees of freedom,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11016v3,"Oliver Friedrich, ChunJun Cao, Sean M. Carroll, Gong Cheng, Ashmeet Singh","The holographic principle suggests that regions of space contain fewer physical degrees of freedom than would be implied by conventional quantum field theory. Meanwhile, in Hilbert spaces of large dimension $2^n$, it is possible to define $N \gg n$ Pauli algebras that are nearly anti-commuting (but not quite) and which can be thought of as ""overlapping degrees of freedom"". We propose to model the phenomenology of holographic theories by allowing field-theory modes to be overlapping, and derive potential observational consequences. In particular, we build a Fermionic quantum field whose effective degrees of freedom approximately obey area scaling and satisfy a cosmic Bekenstein bound, and compare predictions of that model to cosmic neutrino observations. Our implementation of holography implies a finite lifetime of plane waves, which depends on the overall UV cutoff of the theory. To allow for neutrino flux from blazar TXS 0506+056 to be observable, our model needs to have a cutoff $k_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim 500\, k_{\mathrm{LHC}}\,$. This is broadly consistent with current bounds on the energy spectrum of cosmic neutrinos from IceCube, but high energy neutrinos are a potential challenge for our model of holography. We motivate our construction via quantum mereology, i.e. using the idea that EFT degrees of freedom should emerge from an abstract theory of quantum gravity by finding quasi-classical Hilbert space decompositions. We also discuss how to extend the framework to Bosons. Finally, using results from random matrix theory we derive an analytical understanding of the energy spectrum of our theory.

Corresponding nonassociative generalizations of the concepts of classical Shannon entropy, quantum von Neumann entropy, Rényi entropy are formulated. The fundamental geometric and quantum information objects are computed following the Grigori Perelman statistical thermodynamic approach to Ricci flows and gravity theories generalized for phase spaces modelled as (co) tangent Lorentz bundles. Nonassociative parametric deformations and nonholonomic thermo-geometric versions of statistical generating functions, their quantum analogues as density matrices are considered for deriving the entropy, energy and fluctuation functionals. This allows us to define and compute respective classical and quantum relative and conditional entropies, mutual information and nonassociative entanglement and thermodynamic information variables. We formulate the principles of nonassociative quantum geometric and information flow theory, QGIF, and study the basic properties of such quasi-stationary models related to modified gravity theories. Applications are considered for nonassociative deformed and entangled couples of four-dimensional, 4-d, wormholes (defined by respective spacetime and/or momentum type coordinates) and nonassociative QGIFs of 8-d phase space generalized wormholes configurations. Finally, we speculate on phase space black holes and wormholes being transversable for nonassociative qubits, quantum channels and entanglement witness; thought and laboratory experiments are discussed; and perspectives for quantum computer modelling and tests of nonassociative geometric flow and gravity theories are considered.","{'black holes': 1, 'quantum computer': 1}",02.2024,2024,02,"['Black Holes and GR', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

Investigating black hole accretion disks as potential polluter sources for the formation of enriched stars in globular clusters,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10590v1,"Laurane Fréour, Alice Zocchi, Glenn van de Ven, Elena Pancino","Accretion disks surrounding stellar mass black holes (BHs) have been suggested as potential locations for the nucleosynthesis of light elements, which are our primary observational discriminant of multiple stellar populations within globular clusters. The population of enriched stars in globular clusters are enhanced in N14, Na23, and sometimes in Al27 and/or in K39. In this study, our aim is to investigate the feasibility of initiating nucleosynthesis for these four elements in BH accretion disks, considering various internal parameters such as the temperature of the gas and timescale of the accretion. To achieve this, we employed a 132-species reaction network. We used the slim disk model, suitable for the Super-Eddington mass accretion rate and for geometrically and optically thick disks. We explored the conditions related to the mass, mass accretion rate, viscosity, and radius of the BH-accretion disk system that would allow for the creation of N14, Na23, Al27, and K39 before the gas is accreted onto the central object. Our findings reveal that there is no region in the parameter space where the formation of Na23 can occur and only a very limited region where the formation of N14, Al27, and K39 is plausible. Specifically, this occurs for BHs with masses lower than 10 solar masses, with a preference toward even lower mass values and extremely low viscosity parameters ($α<10^{-3}$). Such values are highly unlikely based on current observations of stellar mass BHs. However, such low mass BHs could actually exist in the early universe, as so-called primordial BHs. In conclusion, our study suggests that the nucleosynthesis within BH accretion disks of four elements of interest for the multiple stellar populations is improbable, but not impossible, using the slim disk model.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

By investigating the isobaric and isothermal phase transitions for Bardeen and Hayward AdS black holes in detail, we observe that a dramatic change of quasinormal modes appears near the phase transition point of small and large black holes, and that it corresponds to the swallow tail structure in the plane of Gibbs free energy and pressure. Moreover, by analyzing the evolution of black holes along the coexistence curve of small and large black hole phases, we also observe the dramatic change in quasinormal modes. Such a phenomenon confirms the signal of the phase transition in the quasinormal mode spectrum, which can be understood as a thermodynamic signal hidden in the dynamical spectrum.",{'black holes': 5},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Extremal black hole formation as a critical phenomenon,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10190v1,"Christoph Kehle, Ryan Unger","In this paper, we prove that extremal black holes arise on the threshold of gravitational collapse. More precisely, we construct smooth one-parameter families of smooth, spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-Vlasov system which interpolate between dispersion and collapse and for which the critical solution is an extremal black hole. Physically, these solutions can be understood as beams of gravitationally self-interacting collisionless charged particles fired into Minkowski space from past infinity. Depending on the precise value of the parameter, we show that the Vlasov matter either disperses due to the combined effects of angular momentum and electromagnetic repulsion, or undergoes gravitational collapse. At the critical value of the parameter, an extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole is formed. No naked singularities occur as the extremal threshold is crossed. We call this critical phenomenon extremal critical collapse and the present work constitutes the first rigorous result on the black hole formation threshold in general relativity.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Semi-classical dilaton gravity and the very blunt defect expansion,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10162v1,"Jorrit Kruthoff, Adam Levine","We explore dilaton gravity with general dilaton potentials in the semi-classical limit viewed both as a gas of blunt defects and also as a semi-classical theory in its own right. We compare the exact defect gas picture with that obtained by naively canonically quantizing the theory in geodesic gauge. We find a subtlety in the canonical approach due to a non-perturbative ambiguity in geodesic gauge. Unlike in JT gravity, this ambiguity arises already at the disk level. This leads to a distinct mechanism from that in JT gravity by which the semi-classical approximation breaks down at low temperatures. Along the way, we propose that new, previously un-studied saddles contribute to the density of states of dilaton gravity. This in particular leads to a re-interpretation of the disk-level density of states in JT gravity in terms of two saddles with fixed energy boundary conditions: the disk, which caps off on the outer horizon, and another, sub-leading complex saddle which caps off on the inner horizon. When the theory is studied using a defect expansion, we show how the smooth classical geometries of dilaton gravity arise from a dense gas of very blunt defects in the $G_N \to 0$ limit. The classical saddle points arise from a balance between the attractive force on the defects toward negative dilaton and a statistical pressure from the entropy of the configuration.

In this work, building on previous work on the structure of the space of master functions and equations, we study the reconstruction of the metric perturbations in terms of the master functions. To that end, we consider the general situation in which the perturbations are driven by an arbitrary energy-momentum tensor. Then, we perform the metric reconstruction in a completely general perturbative gauge. In doing so, we investigate the role of Darboux transformations and Darboux covariance, responsible for the isospectrality between odd and even parity in the absence of matter sources and also of the physical equivalence between the descriptions based on all the possible master equations.

Effective yields as tracers of feedback effects on metallicity scaling relations in the EAGLE cosmological simulations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09904v1,"M. C. Zerbo, M. E. De Rossi, M. A. Lara-López, S. A. Cora, L. J. Zenocratti","Effective yields, $y_{\rm eff}$, are defined by fundamental galaxy properties (i.e., stellar mass -$M_{\star}$-, gas mass -$M_{\rm gas}$- and gas-phase metallicity). For a closed-box model, $y_{\rm eff}$ is constant and equivalent to the mass in metals returned to the gas per unit mass locked in long-lived stars. Deviations from such behaviour have been often considered observational signatures of past feedback events. By analysing EAGLE simulations with different feedback models, we evaluate the impact of supernovae (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on $y_{\rm eff}$ at redshift $z=0$. When removing supermassive black holes (BH) and, hence, AGN effects, in simulations, galaxies are located around a plane in the $M_{\star} - M_{\rm gas} - {\rm O/H}$ parameter space (being O/H a proxy for gas metallicity, as usual), with such a plane roughly describing a surface of constant $y_{\rm eff}$. As the ratio between BH mass and $M_{\star}$ increases, galaxies deviate from that plane towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$ as a consequence of AGN feedback. For galaxies not strongly affected by AGN feedback, a stronger SN feedback efficiency generates deviations towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$, while galaxies move towards the opposite side of the plane (i.e., towards higher values of $y_{\rm eff}$) as SN feedback becomes weaker. Star-forming galaxies observed in the Local Universe are located around a similar 3D plane. Our results suggest that the features of the scatter around the observed plane are related to the different feedback histories of galaxies, which might be traced by $y_{\rm eff}$.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Expressivity of parameterized quantum circuits for generative modeling of continuous multivariate distributions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09848v1,"Alice Barthe, Michele Grossi, Sofia Vallecorsa, Jordi Tura, Vedran Dunjko","Parameterized quantum circuits have been extensively used as the basis for machine learning models in regression, classification, and generative tasks. For supervised learning their expressivity has been thoroughly investigated and several universality properties have been proven. However, in the case of quantum generative modeling, the situation is less clear, especially when the task is to model distributions over continuous variables. In this work, we focus on expectation value sampling-based models; models where random variables are sampled classically, encoded with a parametrized quantum circuit, and the expectation value of fixed observables is measured and returned as a sample. We prove the universality of such variational quantum algorithms for the generation of multivariate distributions. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of these models, including fundamental upper bounds on the dimensionality of the distributions these models can represent. We further present a tight trade-off result connecting the needed number of measurements and qubit numbers in order to have universality for a desired dimension of output distribution within an error tolerance. Finally we also show that the data encoding strategy relates to the so-called polynomial chaos expansion, which is an analog of the Fourier expansion.

This subsequently breaks the isospectrality typically observed in vector modes. Numerical evidence strongly indicates isospectral breaking in the vector modes of Einstein-Bumblebee black holes: a pronounced breakage in the real part of the frequencies, while the imaginary component seems less affected.

Identifying the hosts of binary black hole and neutron star-black hole mergers with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09684v1,"Geoffrey Mo, Hsin-Yu Chen","The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has detected over one hundred compact binary mergers in gravitational waves, but the formation history of these binaries remains an open question. Finding the host galaxies of these mergers will provide critical information that reveals how these binaries were formed. However, without an electromagnetic counterpart, localizing gravitational wave events to their hosts is challenging with the current generation of gravitational wave detectors. Next-generation detectors will localize some compact binary mergers to a small volume that allows for direct association with their hosts. To demonstrate the promise these detectors hold, we simulate a population of binary black hole and neutron star-black hole mergers using a next-generation gravitational wave network comprised of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. We find that ~4% of binary black hole events within a redshift of 0.5 and ~3% of neutron star-black hole events within a redshift of 0.3 will be localized to a volume smaller than 100 Mpc^3, the volume in which we expect only one likely host galaxy. With the astrophysical merger rate estimated from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration's third observing run, we expect to precisely localize one binary black hole event every eight days and one neutron star-black hole event every 1.5 months.

The impact of anisotropic sky-sampling on the Hubble constant in numerical relativity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09659v1,Hayley J. Macpherson,"We study the impact of nearby inhomogeneities on an observer's inference of the Hubble constant. Large-scale structures induce a dependence of cosmological parameters on observer position as well as an anisotropic variance of those parameters across an observer's sky. While the former has been explored quite thoroughly, the latter has not. Incomplete sampling of an anisotropic sky could introduce a bias in our cosmological inference if we assume an isotropic expansion law. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of large-scale structure combined with ray tracing to produce synthetic catalogs mimicking the low-redshift Pantheon supernova dataset. Our data contains all general-relativistic contributions to fluctuations in the distances and redshifts along geodesics in the simulation. We use these synthetic observations to constrain $H_0$ for a set of randomly-positioned observers. We study both the dependence on observer position as well as the impact of rotating the sample of supernovae on the observer's sky. We find a 1--2\% variance in $H_0$ between observers when they use an isotropic sample of objects. However, we find the inferred value of $H_0$ can vary by up to 4--6\% when observers simply rotate their Pantheon data set on the sky. While the variances we find are below the level of the ``Hubble tension'', our results may suggest a reduction in the significance of the tension if anisotropy of expansion can be correctly accounted for.",{'geodesics': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

We show that using a classical auto-encoder as an independent preprocessing step can significantly decrease the classification performance of a quantum machine learning algorithm. To ameliorate this issue, we design an architecture that unifies the preprocessing and quantum classification algorithms into a single trainable model: the guided quantum compression model. The utility of this model is demonstrated by using it to identify the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, where the conventional approach proves ineffective.

Mass Beyond Measure: Eccentric Searches for Black Hole Populations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09513v1,"Nicholas DePorzio, Lisa Randall, Zhong-Zhi Xianyu","Stellar mass binary black holes of unknown formation mechanism have been observed, motivating new methods for distinguishing distinct black hole populations. This work explores how the orbital eccentricity of stellar mass binary black holes is a viable conduit for making such distinctions. Four different production mechanisms, and their corresponding eccentricity distributions, are studied in the context of an experimental landscape composed of mHz (LISA), dHz (DECIGO), and Hz (LIGO) range gravitational wave detectors. We expand on prior work considering these effects at fixed population eccentricity. We show that a strong signal corresponding to subsets of eccentric populations is effectively hidden from the mHz and dHz range gravitational wave detectors without the incorporation of high eccentricity waveform templates. Even with sufficiently large eccentricity templates, we find dHz range experiments with a LISA-like level of sensitivity are unlikely to aid in distinguishing different populations. We consider the degree to which a mHz range detector like LISA can differentiate among black hole populations independently and in concert with follow-up merger detection for binaries coalescing within a 10 year period. We find that mHz range detectors, with only $e < 0.01$ (nearly circular) sensitivity, can successfully discern eccentric sub-populations except when attempting to distinguish very low eccentricity distributions. In these cases where $e < 0.01$ sensitivity is insufficient, we find that the increase in event counts resulting from $e < 0.1$ sensitivity provides a statistically significant signal for discerning even these low eccentricity sub-populations. While improvements offered by $e<0.1$ sensitivity can be generally increased by $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factors with $e<0.4$ sensitivity, going beyond this in eccentricity sensitivity provides negligible enhancement.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

This investigation aims to trace the magnetic charge in the gravitational memory effect. Additionally, we consider another family of traversable wormhole solutions obtained from non-exotic matter sources to trace the electric charge Qe in the gravitational memory effect, which can be determined from the far field asymptotic.

In the noninteracting case, quantized Thouless pumps can only occur when a topological singularity is encircled adiabatically. In contrast, here we show that, in the presence of interactions, such topological transport can even persist for exotic paths in which the system gets arbitrarily close to the singularity. We illustrate the robustness of these exotic Thouless pumps through the behavior of the noninteracting singularity, which for sufficiently strong interactions splits into two singularities separated by a spontaneous antiferromagnetic insulator. We perform a numerical benchmark of these phenomena by means of tensor network simulations of ground-state physics and real-time adiabatic dynamics.

Security protocols safeguarding the integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical contexts.

Dynamical 4-D Gauss-Bonnet action from matter-graviton interaction at one-loop,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08965v1,"Susobhan Mandal, S. Shankaranarayanan","The occurrence of singularities at the centers of black holes suggests that general relativity (GR), although a highly successful model of gravity and cosmology, is inapplicable. This is due to the breakdown of the equivalence principle. Gauss-Bonnet (GB) action is a simplest extension of GR as it possess second-order equations of motion and is devoid of ghosts. However, in 4-D, the GB action is topological. Recently, Glavan and Lin proposed a mathematical framework that transforms the 4-D GB gravity theory into a non-topological one. However, it has been argued that without a canonical way to choose 4-D from the higher-dimensional space, such a GB gravity is not well-defined in 4-D. The current work takes a step in addressing this issue by demonstrating that the rescaling of the GB coupling $α\rightarrow α/(D - 4)$ arises from the self-energy correction of gravitons in 4-D via \emph{the dimensional regularization}. To keep things transparent, we focus on the linearized theory of gravity coupled with matter fields. By computing the one-loop self-energy correction of gravitons induced by the matter fields, we explicitly provide the origin of the prescription provided by Glavan and Lin.

Radio-loud fraction of z&gt;6 quasars,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08732v1,"Pascal M. Keller, Nithyanandan Thyagarajan, Ajay Kumar, Nissim Kanekar, Gianni Bernardi","Quasars at redshifts $z>6$ are an excellent probe of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. The population of radio-luminous quasars is of particular interest, as such quasars could potentially be used to study the neutral intergalactic medium during cosmic reionisation via H$\,$I 21$\,$cm absorption studies. However, the lack of deep radio observations of $z>6$ quasars leaves the population poorly constrained, and suitable candidates for an H$\,$I 21$\,$cm absorption study have yet to be found. In this work, we present Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) 1$-$2 GHz radio continuum observations of 138 quasars at redshifts $6.0 \leq z<7.6$. We detect the radio continuum emission of the $z=6.1$ quasar J1034-1425, with a 1.6 GHz flux density of $170\pm 36\,μ$Jy. This quasar is radio-quiet with radio-loudness, $R \equiv f_{5\text{~GHz}}/f_{ν,\text{4400 A}} = 2.4\pm0.5$. In addition, we detect 7 other quasars at z>6, which have previously been characterised in the literature at these frequencies. Using the full sample, we estimate the radio-loud fraction to be $3.8^{+6.2}_{-2.4}\%$, where the uncertainties are 95% confidence intervals. This is lower than recent estimates of the radio-loud fraction in the literature, but is still marginally consistent with no redshift evolution of the radio-loud fraction. We explore the undetected quasar population by stacking their continuum images at their optical positions and obtain a median stacked flux density of $13.8\pm 3.9~μ$Jy and luminosity of $\log{L_{5~\mathrm{GHz}}/(\mathrm{W~Hz}^{-1})}=24.2\pm0.1$.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
The Nature and Evolution of Early Massive Quenched Galaxies in the Simba-C Simulation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08729v1,"Jakub Szpila, Romeel Davé, Douglas Rennehan, Weiguang Cui, Renier Hough","We examine the nature, origin, and fate of early ($z\geq 2$) massive ($M_\star>10^{10}M_\odot$) quenched galaxies (EQGs) in a new $(100h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^3)$ run of the Simba-C galaxy formation model. We define ``quenched'' to be $>4σ$ below an iterative polynomial fit to the star-forming sequence (SFS), and find that Simba-C produces EQGs as early as $z\sim 5$ and number densities agreeing with observations at $z\leq 3$ (though slightly low at $z\geq 4$). Using a photometric-based EQG selection or a fixed sSFR cut of $10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$ yields similar results. EQGs predominantly arise in central galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star\sim 10^{10.5-11.3}M_\odot$, not necessarily the most massive systems. A UMAP projection shows that quenched galaxies have notably large black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, lower rotational support, and less dust, but are not atypical versus similar-mass non-EQGs in their environments, halo mass, or halo gas temperatures at the time of quenching. However, via galaxy tracking we show that the progenitor environments of EQGs are significantly more overdense than that of non-EQGs, which drives higher black hole mass fractions and stellar-to-halo mass ratios. This results in the Eddington ratio dropping sufficiently low for Simba-C's jet mode feedback to turn on, which quickly quenches the host galaxies. EQGs thus seem to be galaxies that grow their black holes quickly within highly dense environments, but end up in moderately-dense environments where black hole feedback can quench effectively. We find that $\geq 30\%$ of EQGs rejuvenate, but the rejuvenating fraction drops quickly at $z\leq 2$. By $z=0$ it is difficult to distinguish the descendants of EQGs vs. non-EQGs.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Arbitrary Polynomial Separations in Trainable Quantum Machine Learning,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08606v1,"Eric R.

We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks in performing a classical sequence modeling task. Furthermore, each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs is computationally efficient, implementable in constant time on a quantum device. The classical networks we prove a separation over include well-known examples such as recurrent neural networks and Transformers.

We find that BPs appear earlier in noisy quantum environments compared to ideal, noise-free conditions.However, strategic selection of qubit measurement observables can effectively tackle this issue. To this end, we examine a variety of observables, such as PauliZ,PauliX, PauliY, and a specially designed arbitrary Hermitian observable, tailored to the requirements of the cost function and the desired outputs of quantum circuits. Our analysis encompasses both global and local cost function definitions, with the former involving measurements across all qubits and the latter focusing on single-qubit measurements within the QNN framework. Our findings indicate that in a global cost function scenario, PauliX and PauliY observables lead to flatter optimization landscapes, signaling BPs with increasing qubits, especially in noisy conditions. Conversely, the PauliZ observable maintains trainability up to 8 qubits but encounters BPs at 10 qubits. Notably, the arbitrary Hermitian observable, when used with a global cost function, shows a unique advantage as it benefits from noise, facilitating effective training up to 10 qubits. Furthermore, with a local cost function, out of the three conventional observables (PauliX, PauliY and PauliZ), PauliZ is more effective, sustaining training efficiency under noisy conditions for up to 10 qubits, while PauliX and PauliY do not show similar benefits and remain susceptible to BPs.

We investigate how a nontrivial Gauss curvature alters the pictures for different amounts of scalar hair around the black holes, quantified by a normalized charge. Our results show that for high values of this charge, close to a boson star limit, chaotic shadows are observed with multiple small disconnected components for all considered Gaussian curvatures. For moderately large amounts of scalar hair and corresponding normalized charge, although the shadows still exhibit chaotic behavior, a dominant shadow component emerges, the size and shape of which are substantially influenced by the Gaussian curvature. For instance, highly chaotic shadows for flat target space, start developing a large central shadow region with the increase of the Gauss curvature even for black holes with substantially heavy scalar hair.

In this work we explore the motion of spinning black holes on a medium. We find that the classical drag along the velocity direction is modified and two novel forces appear: a rotational force, which in the context of fluid dynamics is dubbed the Magnus force, and a lift, orthogonal to the direction of motion. We develop a first-principles fully-relativistic treatment of these spin-induced aerodynamic forces in two types of environment: i) collisionless corpuscular matter and ii) a light scalar field, exploring the differences between both cases. In both cases we find that the total rotational force acts precisely in the opposite direction as compared to the classical set-up of a spinning ball moving through a fluid. Finally, we comment on the consequences of these new effects for astrophysics and gravitational wave observations.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Computational complexity of isometric tensor network states,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07975v1,"Daniel Malz, Rahul Trivedi","We determine the computational power of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS), a variational ansatz originally developed to numerically find and compute properties of gapped ground states and topological states in two dimensions. By mapping 2D isoTNS to 1+1D unitary quantum circuits, we find that computing local expectation values in isoTNS is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete. We then introduce injective isoTNS, which are those isoTNS that are the unique ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians, and which are characterized by an injectivity parameter $δ\in(0,1/D]$, where $D$ is the bond dimension of the isoTNS. We show that injectivity necessarily adds depolarizing noise to the circuit at a rate $η=δ^2D^2$. We show that weakly injective isoTNS (small $δ$) are still $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, but that there exists an efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in strongly injective isoTNS ($η\geq0.41$). Sampling from isoTNS corresponds to monitored quantum dynamics and we exhibit a family of isoTNS that undergo a phase transition from a hard regime to an easy phase where the monitored circuit can be sampled efficiently. Our results can be used to design provable algorithms to contract isoTNS. Our mapping between ground states of certain frustration-free Hamiltonians to open circuit dynamics in one dimension fewer may be of independent interest.",{'tensor network': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Tensor Networks']
Gravitational Collapse in Energy-momentum squared gravity: Nature of singularities,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07957v1,Prabir Rudra,"In this paper, we explore a collapsing scenario in the background of energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG). EMSG claims to have terms that originate from the quantum gravity effects mimicking loop quantum gravity. As a result, the framework admits a bounce at a finite time thus avoiding a singularity. So the question that naturally arises: Is there any realistic chance of the formation of a black hole or the quantum gravity effects are strong enough to totally avoid such a pathology? Motivated by this we are interested in studying a gravitational collapse mechanism in the background of EMSG and investigate the fate of such a process. We model the spacetime of a massive star by the Vaidya metric and derive the field equations in EMSG. Then using the equations we go on to study a gravitational collapse mechanism, on two specific models of EMSG with different forms of curvature-matter coupling. The prime objective is to probe the nature of singularity (if formed) as the end state of the collapse. We see that none of the models generically admit the formation of black holes as the end state of collapse, but on the contrary, they support the formation of naked singularities. This can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational interactions at the fundamental level.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Consistent eccentricities for gravitational wave astronomy: Resolving discrepancies between astrophysical simulations and waveform models,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07892v2,"Aditya Vijaykumar, Alexandra G. Hanselman, Michael Zevin","Detecting imprints of orbital eccentricity in gravitational wave signals promises to shed light on the formation mechanisms of binary black holes. To constrain formation mechanisms, distributions of eccentricity derived from numerical simulations of astrophysical formation channels are compared to the estimates of eccentricity inferred from GW signals. We report that the definition of eccentricity typically used in astrophysical simulations is inconsistent with the one used while modeling GW signals, with the differences mainly arising due to the choice of reference frequency used in both cases. We also posit a prescription for calculating eccentricity from astrophysical simulations by evolving ordinary differential equations obtained from post-Newtonian theory, and using the dominant ($\ell = m =2$) mode's frequency as the reference frequency; this ensures consistency in the definitions. On comparing the existing eccentricities of binaries present in the Cluster Monte Carlo catalog of globular cluster simulations with the eccentricities calculated using the prescription presented here, we find a significant discrepancy at $e \gtrsim 0.2$; this discrepancy becomes worse with increasing eccentricity. We note the implications this discrepancy has for existing studies, and recommend that care be taken when comparing data-driven constraints on eccentricity to expectations from astrophysical formation channels.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

We then analyze the nature of the horizon and the corresponding surface gravity outside and inside the star. The Hayward and Nielsen-Visser dynamical surface gravity are in agreement with the one resulting from the Killing vector of the outer static metric. However, these two definitions inside the star do not coincide with the Killing surface gravity outside the star when the star crosses the event horizon. This motivates us to study the surface gravity using Fodor's approach to have a unique surface gravity at the mentioned moment.

In a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, the number of field equations is thus reduced to two. The equation of pressure isotropy of general relativity, however, is preserved thus showing that any known perfect fluid spacetime is a suitable candidate for the trace-free scenario. The extra freedom in imposing two constraints may now be exploited to include polytopes, something that is difficult in general relativity. The point here is that using any known exact solution one can find a polytropic star for various values of the polytropic index. One arrives at Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff type equations and can study their solutions explicitly. Two examples of well-known stellar distributions that generate polytropes with physically reasonable behaviour are discussed.

Love numbers and Love symmetries for $p$-form and gravitational perturbations of higher-dimensional spherically symmetric black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07574v1,Panagiotis Charalambous,"The static Love numbers of four-dimensional asymptotically flat, isolated, general-relativistic black holes are known to be identically vanishing. The Love symmetry proposal suggests that such vanishings are addressed by selection rules following from the emergence of an enhanced $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ (``Love'') symmetry in the near-zone region; more specifically, it is the fact that the black hole perturbations belong to a highest-weight representation of this near-zone $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry, rather than the existence of the Love symmetry itself, that outputs the vanishings of the corresponding Love numbers. In higher spacetime dimensions, some towers of magic zeroes with regards to the black hole response problem have also been reported for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Here, we extend these results by supplementing with $p$-form perturbations of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. We furthermore analytically extract the static Love numbers and the leading order dissipation numbers associated with spin-$0$ scalar and spin-$2$ tensor-type tidal perturbations of the higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordström black hole. We find that Love symmetries exist and that the vanishings of the static Love numbers are captured by representation theory arguments even for these higher spin perturbations of the higher-dimensional spherically symmetric black holes of General Relativity. Interestingly, these near-zone $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ structures acquire extensions to Witt algebras. Our setup allows to also study the $p$-form response problem of a static spherically symmetric black hole in a generic theory of gravity. We perform explicit computations for some black holes in the presence of string-theoretic corrections and investigate under what geometric conditions Love symmetries emerge in the near-zone.",{'black holes': 3},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

A total of 50 and 10 X-ray sources are found positionally coincident with the nuclei of member galaxies in Virgo and Fornax, respectively, down to a 0.2--2.3 keV luminosity of $\sim10^{39}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and reaching out to a projected distance well beyond the virial radius of both clusters. The majority of the nuclear X-ray sources are newly identified. There is weak evidence that the nuclear X-ray sources are preferentially found in late-type hosts. Several hosts are dwarf galaxies with a stellar mass below $\sim10^{9}\rm~M_\odot$. We find that contamination by non-nuclear X-ray emission can be neglected in most cases, indicating the dominance of a genuine AGN. In the meantime, no nuclear X-ray source exhibits a luminosity higher than a few times $10^{41}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$. The X-ray AGN occupation rate is only $\sim$3\% in both clusters, apparently much lower than that in field galaxies inferred from previous X-ray studies.

The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly-available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low mass galaxies up to $z\sim1$. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that $z\sim 0.5-4$ variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is consistent with most previous studies of the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts.

Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Radiative Hybrid Inflation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06613v1,"Adeela Afzal, Anish Ghoshal","We study the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition due to the effects of one-loop radiative corrections of Yukawa couplings between the inflaton and a dark fermion in a non-supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model. We obtain a spectral index, $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$ consistent with the current Planck data. Our findings show that the abundance of PBHs are correlated to the dark fermion mass $m_N$ and peak in the GW spectrum. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire dark matter (DM) candidate of the universe or a fraction of it. Our predictions are consistent with any existing constraints of PBH from microlensing, BBN, and CMB, etc. Moreover, the scenario is also testable via induced gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order scalar perturbations detectable in future observatories such as LISA and ET. For instance, with inflaton mass $m \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $m_N \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV, we obtain PBHs of around $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ mass that can explain the entire abundance of DM and predict GWs with amplitude $Ω_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ with peak frequency $f$ $\sim$ $0.1$ Hz in LISA. By explicitly estimating fine-tuning we show the model has very mild tuning. We discuss successful reheating at the end of the inflationary phase via the conversion of the waterfall field into standard model (SM) particles. We also briefly speculate a scenario where the dark fermion can be the possible heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) which is responsible for generating the SM neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The RHN can be produced due to waterfall field decay and its subsequent decay may also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. For this purpose, we derived a matrix product operator representation of the loss function Hamiltonian and the penalty terms. Numerical trials with this algorithm successfully yielded approximate solutions, while exhibiting a tradeoff between accuracy and runtime.

Distinguishing the Observational Signatures of Hot Spots Orbiting Reissner-Nordström Spacetime,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06413v1,"Tianshu Wu, Yiqian Chen","This paper delves into observable signatures of hot spots orbiting Reissner-Nordström (RN) black holes and naked singularities. In a RN black hole case, we find two discernible lensing image tracks in time integrated images capturing a complete orbit of hot spots, and a image shadow within the critical curve where photons with a small impact parameter fall into the event horizon. Conversely, in RN singularities, additional image tracks can be found inner the critical curve, originating from photons reflected by the infinitely high effective potential well. Moreover, we found incomplete and converge tracks from the time integrated images of hot spot orbiting RN singularities lacking of a photon sphere. The presence of these additional image tracks exerts a significant influence on temporal magnitudes at their local maxima, allowing us to differentiate between RN black holes and RN naked singularities.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Stellar streams from black hole-rich star clusters,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06393v1,"Daniel Roberts, Mark Gieles, Denis Erkal, Jason L. Sanders","Nearly a hundred progenitor-less, thin stellar streams have been discovered in the Milky Way, thanks to Gaia and related surveys. Most streams are believed to have formed from star clusters and it was recently proposed that extended star clusters -- rich in stellar-mass black holes (BHs) -- are efficient in creating streams. To understand the nature of stream progenitors better, we quantify the differences between streams originating from star clusters with and without BHs using direct $N$-body models and a new model for the density profiles of streams based on time-dependent escape rates from clusters. The QSG (Quantifying Stream Growth) model facilitates the rapid exploration of parameter space and provides an analytic framework to understand the impact of different star cluster properties and escape conditions on the structure of streams. Using these models it is found that, compared to streams from BH-free clusters on the same orbit, streams of BH-rich clusters: (1) are approximately five times more massive; (2) have a peak density three times closer to the cluster 1 Gyr post-dissolution (for orbits of Galactocentric radius > 10 kpc), and (3) have narrower peaks and more extended wings in their density profile. We discuss other observable stream properties that are affected by the presence of BHs in their progenitor cluster, namely the width of the stream, its radial offset from the orbit, and the properties of the gap at the progenitor's location. Our results provide a step towards using stellar streams to constrain the BH content of dissolved (globular) star clusters.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

These states generalize the notion of $k$-pairable states introduced by Bravyi et al., and can be studied from a combinatorial perspective using graph states and $k$-vertex-minor universal graphs. First, we demonstrate the existence of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states that are optimal in size with $n=Θ(k^2)$ qubits. We also provide parameters for which a random graph state on $Θ(k^2)$ qubits is $k$-stabilizer universal with high probability. Our second contribution consists of two explicit constructions of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states on $n = O(k^4)$ qubits. Both rely upon the incidence graph of the projective plane over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. This provides a major improvement over the previously known explicit construction of $k$-pairable graph states with $n = O(2^{3k})$, bringing forth a new and potentially powerful family of multipartite quantum resources.",{'stabilizer state': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Tensor Networks']
Schrödinger Connections: From Mathematical Foundations Towards Yano-Schrödinger Cosmology,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06167v1,Lehel Csillag,"In the present paper we introduce a novel coordinate-free formulation of Schrödinger connections, which are a special class of affine connections, first considered by Schrödinger. After recasting some basic properties in a differential geometric language, we show that Schrödinger connections can be realized through torsion, non-metricity or both. Considering a semi-symmetric type of torsion and a Weyl type non-metricity, the curvature tensors of Weyl-Schrödinger, Yano-Schrödinger and Friedmann-Weyl-Schrödinger connections are calculated. With the help of a de Sitter type FLRW metric and a Yano-Schrödinger connection, we construct for the first time in the literature an explicit example of a non-static Einstein manifold realized by torsion. Having presented the mathematical foundations, we propose a geometric generalization of standard general relativity based on Yano-Schrödinger geometry. After formulating the Einstein equations, we derive the Friedmann equations and obtain analytical de Sitter solutions. The physical feasability of the proposed theory is tested by considering a cosmological model in which matter is conserved. The theoretical predictions of Yano-Schrödinger gravity are compared with observational data for the Hubble function and with the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm.

Barycentric and Pairwise Renyi Quantum Leakage,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06156v1,Farhad Farokhi,"Barycentric and pairwise quantum Renyi leakages are proposed as two measures of information leakage for privacy and security analysis in quantum computing and communication systems. These quantities both require minimal assumptions on the eavesdropper, i.e., they do not make any assumptions on the eavesdropper's attack strategy or the statistical prior on the secret or private classical data encoded in the quantum system. They also satisfy important properties of positivity, independence, post-processing inequality, and unitary invariance. The barycentric quantum Renyi leakage can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and the pairwise quantum Renyi leakage possesses an explicit formula. The barycentric and pairwise quantum Renyi leakages form upper bounds on the maximal quantum leakage, the sandwiched quantum $α$-mutual information, the accessible information, and the Holevo's information. Furthermore, differentially-private quantum channels are shown to bound these measures of information leakage. Global and local depolarizing channels, that are common models of noise in quantum computing and communication, restrict private or secure information leakage. Finally, a privacy-utility trade-off formula in quantum machine learning using variational circuits is developed. The privacy guarantees can only be strengthened, i.e., information leakage can only be reduced, if the performance degradation grows larger and vice versa.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In this study, we introduce a novel approach to quantum neural network construction, specifically addressing the issues of VG and CFC. Our methodology employs ensemble learning, advocating for the simultaneous deployment of multiple quantum circuits with a depth equal to $1$, a departure from the conventional use of a single quantum circuit with depth $L$.

Background independent tensor networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05910v1,"Chris Akers, Annie Y. Wei","Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way, all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further: they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.",{'tensor networks': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Tensor Networks']

The non-collinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05759v1,"R. Rausch, C. Karrasch","The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a double-Q structure for the apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, two peaks merge into a single one indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible to external perturbations; they form a large number of gapless magnetic states that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and a gapless peak at $k=π/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the $k=π/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure. Our results are relevant, e.g., for the material atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in high magnetic fields.",{'tensor network': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Tensor Networks']

This study delves into two distinct characteristics of the waveforms emitted from such wormholes, namely, the late-time tails and echoes, which can substantially be used to distinguish its identity. Notably, both features appear in the latter stages of quasinormal oscillations and stem from the singularities of the Green's function. The late-time tail, on the one hand, arises due to the branch cuts in the relevant Green's function. Within the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole paradigm, singularities are present in both ingoing and outgoing waveforms, which entails a generalization of the existing recipe for black hole metrics. On the other hand, the echoes are attributed to a new set of quasinormal poles, supplementing those of the respective black holes, reminiscent of the scenario where the spacetime metric possesses a discontinuity. It is inferred that both features are observationally relevant in distinguishing a wormhole from its black hole counterpart. Moreover, we suggest a potential interplay concerning the late-time evolution between the two mechanisms in question.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The increasing entropy has a natural expression in covariant phase space language, which makes it manifestly invariant under JKM ambiguities. An explicit entropy formula is given for f(Riemann) gravity coupled to vectors, where at most one derivative acts on each vector.

These Yukawa-type corrections are essentially described along two parameters, $β$ and $λ$, affecting Newton's law of gravity at large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which is essential at short distances. Primarily, the strongest effect is encoded in $β$, which alters the total mass of the black hole with additional mass proportional to $β\mathcal{M}$, imitating the effects of dark matter at large distances from the black hole. In contrast, the effect due to $λ$ is small for astrophysical values. On the other hand, the EGB gravity is ruled by the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling constant $α$, a fundamental parameter of the theory. We pay particular attention to thermodynamic stability, critical orbits, geodesics and quasinormal modes. The results demonstrate stability of the black hole solution for a range of values of the GB coupling constant $α$.

Weight Reduced Stabilizer Codes with Lower Overhead,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05228v1,"Eric Sabo, Lane G. Gunderman, Benjamin Ide, Michael Vasmer, Guillaume Dauphinais","Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of parity-check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings proposed a method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code, though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we instead focus on the regime of small-to-medium size codes suitable for quantum computing hardware. We provide both a fully explicit description of Hastings's method and propose a substantially simplified weight reduction method that is applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph and lifted product codes to at most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining (in fact often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor, but we find that our method is much more efficient than Hastings's method in this regard. We benchmark the performance of our codes in a photonic quantum computing architecture based on GKP qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our weight reduction method substantially improves code performance.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In this paper, we show how it can sheed light on a long standing problem in physics, the quest for magnetic monopoles in the Universe. Placing them in the interior of primordial rotating black holes, which act as natural amplifiers, we show that massive charged bosonic fields in their vicinity exhibit a superradiant instability which surpasses significantly that of neutral Kerr black holes. Strikingly, this is true for black holes containing an order-one number of magnetic monopoles, or merely a single one, and possessing either low, moderate or large values of angular momentum. In particular, the instability is drastically faster than the radiative decay time of charged pions, thus making it physically relevant. Furthermore, our analysis identifies the most unstable modes as a class of monopole spheroidal harmonics, that we dub north and south monopole modes, whose morphology is markedly different from the usual superradiantly unstable modes since they extend along the rotational axis.

We use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity to study its canonical ensemble and thermodynamics. We give the action, energy, entropy, temperature, and heat capacity. $T$, $Λ$, the black hole radius $r_+$, and the cosmological horizon radius $r_{\rm c}$, are gauged in $R$ units to $RT$, $ΛR^2$, $\frac{r_+}{R}$, and $\frac{r_{\rm c}}{R}$. The whole extension of $ΛR^2$, $0\leqΛR^2\leq 3$, is divided into three ranges. The first, $0\leqΛR^2<1$, includes York's Schwarzschild black holes. The second range, $ΛR^2=1$, opens up a folder of Nariai universes. The third range, $1<ΛR^2\leq 3$, is unusual. One feature here is that it interchanges the cosmological horizon with the black hole horizon. The end point, $ΛR^2=3$, only existing for infinite $RT$, is a cavity filled with de Sitter space, except for a singularity, with the cosmological horizon coinciding with the reservoir. For the three ranges, for low temperatures, there are no black holes and no Nariai universes, the space is hot de Sitter. The value of $RT$ that divides the nonexistence from existence of black holes or Nariai universes, depends on $ΛR^2$. For each $ΛR^2\neq1$, for high temperatures, there is one small and thermodynamically unstable black hole, and one large and stable. For $ΛR^2=1$, for high temperatures, there is the unstable black hole, and the neutrally stable Nariai universe. Phase transitions can be analyzed.

Yet, there is still an inhomogeneous coverage of molecular gas tracers. To measure the average excitation and mass of the molecular gas reservoirs in the brightest z>6.5 QSO hosts, we combined new observations of CO(2-1) emission with existing observations of CO(6-5), CO(7-6), [C I], [C II], and dust-continuum emission. We reduced and analysed the VLA observations of CO(2-1) in three z=6.5-6.9 QSO hosts--the highest redshift observations of CO(2-1) to date. By combining these with the nine z=5.7-6.4 QSO hosts for which CO(2-1) has already been observed, we studied the spread in molecular gas masses and CO excitation. Two of our three QSOs, were undetected in CO(2-1), implying more highly excited CO than in the z=6.4 QSO J1148+5251. We detected CO(2-1) at $5.1σ$ for our highest-redshift target, J2348-3054, yielding a molecular gas mass of $(1.2\pm0.2)\times 10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. This molecular gas mass is equivalent to the lower limit on the dynamical mass measured from resolved [C II] observations, implying little mass in stars or neutral gas within the [C II]-emitting region. On average, these QSO hosts have far higher CO(6-5)-, CO(7-6)-, and [C II] vs CO(2-1) line ratios than local AGN hosts; with a mean CO(6-5)-to-CO(1-0) line luminosity ratio of $r_{6,1}=0.9\pm0.2$.

In particular, we construct a canonical system of coordinates which exploits the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime. They are based on a relativistic generalization of the classical Andoyer variables of Newtonian rigid body motion. This canonical setup, then, allows us to derive ready-to-use formulae for action-angle coordinates and gauge-invariant Hamiltonian frequencies, which automatically include all linear-in-spin effects. No external parameters or ad hoc choices are necessary, and the framework can be used to find complete solutions by quadrature of generic, bound, linear-in-spin orbits, including orbital inclination, precession and eccentricity, as well as spin precession. We demonstrate the strength of the formalism in the simple setting of circular orbits with arbitrary spin and orbital precession, and validate them against known results in the literature.",{'geodesics': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum Tensor Product Decomposition from Choi State Tomography,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05018v1,"Refik Mansuroglu, Arsalan Adil, Michael J. Hartmann, Zoë Holmes, Andrew T. Sornborger","The Schmidt decomposition is the go-to tool for measuring bipartite entanglement of pure quantum states. Similarly, it is possible to study the entangling features of a quantum operation using its operator-Schmidt, or tensor product decomposition. While quantum technological implementations of the former are thoroughly studied, entangling properties on the operator level are harder to extract in the quantum computational framework because of the exponential nature of sample complexity. Here we present an algorithm for unbalanced partitions into a small subsystem and a large one (the environment) to compute the tensor product decomposition of a unitary whose effect on the small subsystem is captured in classical memory while the effect on the environment is accessible as a quantum resource. This quantum algorithm may be used to make predictions about operator non-locality, effective open quantum dynamics on a subsystem, as well as for finding low-rank approximations and low-depth compilations of quantum circuit unitaries. We demonstrate the method and its applications on a time-evolution unitary of an isotropic Heisenberg model in two dimensions.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Challenges and opportunities in the supervised learning of quantum circuit outputs,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04992v1,"Simone Cantori, Sebastiano Pilati","Recently, deep neural networks have proven capable of predicting some output properties of relevant random quantum circuits, indicating a strategy to emulate quantum computers alternative to direct simulation methods such as, e.g., tensor-network methods. However, the reach of this alternative strategy is not yet clear. Here we investigate if and to what extent neural networks can learn to predict the output expectation values of circuits often employed in variational quantum algorithms, namely, circuits formed by layers of CNOT gates alternated with random single-qubit rotations. On the one hand, we find that the computational cost of supervised learning scales exponentially with the inter-layer variance of the random angles. This allows entering a regime where quantum computers can easily outperform classical neural networks. On the other hand, circuits featuring only inter-qubit angle variations are easily emulated. In fact, thanks to a suitable scalable design, neural networks accurately predict the output of larger and deeper circuits than those used for training, even reaching circuit sizes which turn out to be intractable for the most common simulation libraries, considering both state-vector and tensor-network algorithms. We provide a repository of testing data in this regime, to be used for future benchmarking of quantum devices and novel classical algorithms.",{'random quantum circuits': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Quantum vortex stability in draining fluid flows,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04961v2,Sam Patrick,"Quantum vortices with more than a single circulation quantum are usually unstable and decay into clusters of smaller vortices. One way to prevent the decay is to place the vortex at the centre of a convergent (draining) fluid flow, which tends to force vortices together. It is found that whilst the primary splitting instability is suppressed in this way (and completely quenched for strong enough flows) a secondary instability can emerge in circular trapping geometries. This behaviour is related to an instability of rotating black holes when superradiantly amplified waves are confined inside a reflective cavity. The end state of the secondary instability is dramatic, manifesting as a shock wave that propagates round the circular wall and nucleates many more vortices.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Cosmological Observatories,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04305v2,"Dionysios Anninos, Damián A. Galante, Chawakorn Maneerat","We study the static patch of de Sitter space in the presence of a timelike boundary. We impose that the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, $K$, are fixed at the boundary. We present the thermodynamic structure of de Sitter space subject to these boundary conditions, for static and spherically symmetric configurations to leading order in the semiclassical approximation. In three spacetime dimensions, and taking $K$ constant on a toroidal Euclidean boundary, we find that the spacetime is thermally stable for all $K$. In four spacetime dimensions, the thermal stability depends on the value of $K$. It is established that for sufficiently large $K$, the de Sitter static patch subject to conformal boundary conditions is thermally stable. This contrasts the Dirichlet problem for which the region encompassing the cosmological horizon has negative specific heat. We present an analysis of the linearised Einstein equations subject to conformal boundary conditions. In the worldline limit of the timelike boundary, the underlying modes are linked to the quasinormal modes of the static patch. In the limit where the timelike boundary approaches the cosmological event horizon, the linearised modes are interpreted in terms of the shear and sound modes of a fluid dynamical system. Additionally, we find modes with a frequency of positive imaginary part.

Classical and Quantum Computing of Shear Viscosity for $2+1D$ SU(2) Gauge Theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04221v2,"Francesco Turro, Anthony Ciavarella, Xiaojun Yao","We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density $\fracη{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result $\frac{1}{4π}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ hexagonal lattice with the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency $\frac{ρ^{xy}(ω)}ω$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small.
  Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite size effects and Trotter errors. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

A toy model that can be considered imitating such a process is colliding null sources in general relativity. We present such a simple model projected into the plane of null coordinates that takes into account only neutral sources. We show that even at such a simplified model, uncharged and non-rotating, it is possible to obtain jet-like ejections albeit they lie below the horizon. In the present study the spacetime consists of either one of i) a cloud of strings, ii) a global monopole, iii) a particular model of bumblebee gravity, all described by a similar class of stress-energy tensor. There are gravitational waves accompanying the null sources and naturally collision of gravitational waves is also taken into account.

Quantum error mitigation by layerwise Richardson extrapolation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04000v1,"Vincent Russo, Andrea Mari","A widely used method for mitigating errors in noisy quantum computers is Richardson extrapolation, a technique in which the overall effect of noise on the estimation of quantum expectation values is captured by a single parameter that, after being scaled to larger values, is eventually extrapolated to the zero-noise limit. We generalize this approach by introducing \emph{layerwise Richardson extrapolation (LRE)}, an error mitigation protocol in which the noise of different individual layers (or larger chunks of the circuit) is amplified and the associated expectation values are linearly combined to estimate the zero-noise limit. The coefficients of the linear combination are analytically obtained from the theory of multivariate Lagrange interpolation. LRE leverages the flexible configurational space of layerwise unitary folding, allowing for a more nuanced mitigation of errors by treating the noise level of each layer of the quantum circuit as an independent variable. We provide numerical simulations demonstrating scenarios where LRE achieves superior performance compared to traditional (single-variable) Richardson extrapolation.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
The Bethe Ansatz for the superconformal index with unequal angular momenta,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03977v2,"Ofer Aharony, Ohad Mamroud, Shimon Nowik, Meir Weissman","A few years ago it was shown that the superconformal index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the large $N$ limit matches with the entropy of $1/16$-supersymmetric black holes in type IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. In some cases, an even more detailed match between the two sides is possible. When the two angular momentum chemical potentials in the index are equal, the superconformal index can be written as a discrete sum of Bethe ansatz solutions, and it was shown that specific terms in this sum are in a one-to-one correspondence to stable black hole solutions, and that the matching can be extended to non-perturbative contributions from wrapped D3-branes. A Bethe ansatz approach to computing the superconformal index exists also when the ratio of the angular momentum chemical potentials is any rational number, but in those cases it involves a sum over a very large number of terms (growing exponentially with $N$). Benini et al showed that a specific one of these terms matches with the black hole, but the role of the other terms is not clear. In this paper we analyze some of the additional contributions to the index in the Bethe ansatz approach, and we find that their matching to the gravity side is much more complicated than in the case of equal chemical potentials. In particular, we find some contributions that are larger than the one which was found to match the black holes, so that they must cancel with other large contributions. We give some evidence that cancellations of this type are possible, but we leave a full understanding of how they work to the future.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Five out of the six candidates are detected with CO(4-3) or CO(5-4) emission, and four in 2mm dust continuum.

Emergent flux in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03875v2,"Qi Song, Jie Lou, Yan Chen","We find a novel chiral superfluid (CSF) phase in a chain of Bose-Fermi mixture, which has been validated using two unbiased numerical methods, density matrix renormalization group and Grassmann multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz.

In the CSF phase, bosons condensate at non-zero momentum $\pm 2π/L$ with chain length $L$. In essence, the local superfluid order parameter continuously rotates along the chain, indicating that the CSF phase spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry breaking gives rise to an emergent flux in the background, effectively optimizing the kinetic energy of the composite fermions within the system. We provide a physical understanding at the mean-field level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 1D CSF phase can emerge in a more widely applicable extended Hubbard model.

The proposed workflow points to the importance of data embeddings and classical post-processing, while keeping the variational circuit as a trivial identity operator. Next, developing the intuition for the function learning, we visualize instances as directed computational hypergraphs, and observe that the GQML protocol can access their global topological features for distinguishing bijective and surjective functions.

However, the lowest mass seeds ($\lesssim10^3 M_{\odot}$) are inaccessible to most cosmological simulations due to resolution limitations. We present our new BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations that uses a novel flexible seeding approach to represent low mass seeds. Our suite consists of two types of boxes that model $\sim10^3~M_{\odot}$ seeds using two distinct but mutually consistent seeding prescriptions at different simulation resolutions. First, we have the highest resolution $[9~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-9-D3) boxes that directly resolve $\sim10^3~M_{\odot}$ seeds and place them within halos with dense and metal poor gas. Second, we have lower-resolution and larger-volume $[18~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-18-E4) and $\sim[36~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-36-E5) boxes that seed their smallest resolvable $\sim10^4~\&~10^5~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ BH descendants using new stochastic seeding prescriptions calibrated using the BRAHMA-9-D3 results. The three boxes together probe BHs between $\sim10^3-10^7 M_{\odot}$ at $z>7$ and we predict their key observables. The variation in the AGN luminosity functions is small (factors of $\sim2-3$) at the anticipated detection limits of potential future X-ray facilities ($\sim10^{43} \mathrm{ergs~s^{-1}}$ at $z\sim7$). Our simulations predict BHs $\sim10-100$ times heavier than expectations from local $M_*$ vs $M_{bh}$ relations, consistent with several JWST-detected AGN. For different seed models, our simulations merge BH binaries at $\sim1-15~\mathrm{kpc}$, with rates of $\sim200-2000$ per year for $\gtrsim10^3 M_{\odot}$ BHs, $\sim6-60$ per year for $\gtrsim10^4~M_{\odot}$ BHs, and up to $\sim10$ per year amongst $\gtrsim10^5 M_{\odot}$ BHs.

In particular, we focus on post-inflationary scenarios where there are no self-resonances and the reheating epoch can be described {by the inflaton evolving in} a quadratic-like potential. In the hydrodynamical interpretation of this field during the slow-reheating epoch, the gravitational collapse of primordial fluctuations is subject to conditions on their sphericity, limits on their spin, as well as a maximum velocity dispersion.

The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is anticipated to annually detect hundreds to thousands of TDEs, such that the first gravitationally lensed TDE may be observed in the coming years. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we quantify the rate of both unlensed and lensed TDEs as a function of limiting magnitudes in four different optical bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$) for a range of TDE temperatures that match observations. Dependent on the temperature and luminosity model, we find that $g$ and $r$ bands are the most promising bands with unlensed TDE detections that can be as high as ${\sim}10^{4}$ annually. By populating a cosmic volume with realistic distributions of TDEs and galaxies that can act as gravitational lenses, we estimate that a few lensed TDEs (depending on the TDE luminosity model) can be detected annually in $g$ or $r$ bands in the LSST survey, with TDE redshifts in the range of ${\sim}0.5$ to ${\sim}2$. The ratio of lensed to unlensed detections indicates that we may detect ${\sim}1$ lensed event for every $10^{4}$ unlensed events, which is independent of the luminosity model. The number of lensed TDEs decreases as a function of the image separations and time delays, and most of the lensed TDE systems are expected to have image separations below ${\sim}3""$ and time delays within ${\sim}30$ days. At fainter limiting magnitudes, the $i$ band becomes notably more successful. These results suggest that strongly lensed TDEs are likely to be observed within the coming years and such detections will enable us to study the demographics of black holes at higher redshifts through the lensing magnifications.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Nonlocal growth of quantum conditional mutual information under decoherence,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03439v1,"Yifan Zhang, Sarang Gopalakrishnan","Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth. We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures than for measurements.",{'random quantum circuits': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Sequential Adiabatic Generation of Chiral Topological States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03433v1,"Xie Chen, Michael Hermele, David T. Stephen","In previous work, it was shown that non-trivial gapped states can be generated from a product state using a sequential quantum circuit. Explicit circuit constructions were given for a variety of gapped states at exactly solvable fixed points. In this paper, we show that a similar generation procedure can be established for chiral topological states as well, despite the fact that they lack an exactly solvable form. Instead of sequentially applying local unitary gates, we sequentially evolve the Hamiltonian by changing local terms in one subregion and then the next. The Hamiltonian remains gapped throughout the process, giving rise to an adiabatic evolution mapping the ground state from a product state to a chiral topological state. We demonstrate such a sequential adiabatic generation process for free fermion chiral states like the Chern Insulator and the $p+ip$ superconductor. Moreover, we show that coupling a quantum state to a discrete gauge group can be achieved through a sequential quantum circuit, thereby generating interacting chiral topological states from the free fermion ones.",{'quantum circuit': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Primordial Black Holes from Axion Domain Wall Collapse,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03426v2,"David I. Dunsky, Marius Kongsore","The QCD axion can solve the Strong CP Problem and be the dark matter of our universe. If the PQ symmetry breaking scale associated with the axion is below the inflationary reheating temperature, axion strings and domain walls populate the universe. Most of these strings and walls decay away into axion dark matter, but a small subset of the walls will be self-enclosed surfaces that are not attached to any strings. These enclosed walls can collapse in on themselves, compressing a large amount of energy into a small volume and potentially forming primordial black holes (PBHs). We study the number density and dynamics of these self-enclosed walls, taking into account their size distribution, Hubble expansion, asphericities, and all stages of domain wall dynamics using a combination of semi-analytic and numerical approaches. We find that axion models with a high axion decay constant $f_a$, such as those of interest in early matter-dominated cosmologies, yield a PBH abundance potentially observable by future gravitational lensing surveys. We note that the formalism developed here is also useful for predicting relic PBH abundances in other models that exhibit unstable domain walls.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons, will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.",{'AdS/CFT': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Holography']

The authors state that the ``simulation of such logical circuits is challenging'' and project the simulation time to grow rapidly with the number of CNOT layers added, see Figure 5d/bottom therein. However, we report a classical simulation algorithm that takes only $0.00257947$ seconds to compute an amplitude for the $48$-qubit computation, which is roughly $10^3$ times faster than that reported by the original authors. Our algorithm is furthermore not subject to a significant decline in performance due to the additional CNOT layers.

Robust Angle Finding for Generalized Quantum Signal Processing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03016v1,"Shuntaro Yamamoto, Nobuyuki Yoshioka","Quantum Signal Processing (QSP), together with the quantum singular value transformation, is one of the central quantum algorithms due to its efficiency and generality in many fields including quantum simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum cryptography. The largest bottleneck of QSP and its family is its difficulty in finding the phase angle sequence for signal processing. We find that this is in particular prominent when one employs the generalized formalism of the QSP, or the GQSP, to employ arbitrary single-qubit unitaries for signal processing operator. In this work, we extend the framework of GQSP and propose a robust angle finding algorithm. The proposed angle finding algorithm, based on Prony's method, successfully generates angle sequence of precision $10^{-13}$ up to polynomial degrees of hundreds within a second.

We locate two closed surfaces, defining \emph{inversion coronas} (spherical shells), surrounding the central attractor. The coronas analysis highlights observational aspects distinguishing the central attractors and providing indications on their spin and the orbiting fluids.
  The inversion corona is a closed region, generally of small extension and thickness, which is for the counter-rotating flows of the order of $\lesssim 1.4 M$ (central attractor mass) on the vertical rotational axis.
  There are no co-rotating inversion points (from co-rotating flows). The results point to strong signatures of the Kerr super-spinars, provided in both accretion and jet flows. With very narrow thickness, and varying little with the fluid initial conditions and the emission process details, inversion coronas can have remarkable observational significance for primordial Kerr super-spinars predicted by string theory.

The commonly used gate-based QML models are convenient for software engineers, but their expressivity is restricted by the permissible circuit depth within a finite coherence time. In contrast, pulse-based models enable the construction of ""infinitely"" deep quantum neural networks within the same coherence time, which may unleash greater expressive power for complex learning tasks. In this paper, we investigate this potential from the perspective of quantum control theory. We first indicate that the nonlinearity of pulse-based models comes from the encoding process that can be viewed as the continuous limit of data-reuploading in gate-based models. Subsequently, we prove that the pulse-based model can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions when the underlying physical system is ensemble controllable. Under this condition, numerical simulations show that the expressivity can be enhanced by either increasing the pulse length or the number of qubits. As anticipated, we demonstrate through numerical examples that the pulse-based model can unleash more expressive power compared to the gate-based model.

This solution is axially symmetric and non-asymptotically flat, and its north and south hemispheres spin in opposite directions. Due to repulsive effects arising from the swirl of the background spacetime, the equilibrium torus exists only in the case with the small swirling parameter. With the increase of the swirling parameter, the disk structure becomes small and the excretion of matter near the black hole becomes strong. Moreover, the odd $Z_2$ symmetry of spacetimes originating from the swirling parameter yields that the orientation of closed equipotential surfaces deviates away from the horizontal axis and the corresponding disk does not longer possess the symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane.

This study shows numerical evidence for a quadratic speedup of the Grover Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (G-QAOA) over random sampling for finding all solutions to 3-SAT problems (All-SAT). G-QAOA is less resource-intensive and more adaptable for 3-SAT and Max-SAT than Grover's algorithm, and it surpasses conventional QAOA in its ability to sample all solutions. We show these benefits by classical simulations of many-round G-QAOA on thousands of random 3-SAT instances. We also observe G-QAOA advantages on the IonQ Aria quantum computer for small instances, finding that current hardware suffices to determine and sample all solutions. Interestingly, a single-angle-pair constraint that uses the same pair of angles at each G-QAOA round greatly reduces the classical computational overhead of optimizing the G-QAOA angles while preserving its quadratic speedup.

We further consider the efficiency of energy extraction from black holes with $(n-1)$ and $n$ rotations. We show that when black hole has $(n-1)$ rotations it has only one horizon and hence the energy efficiency is infinitely large even without MPP. If black hole has $n$ rotations in $D>4$, the energy efficiency becomes not infinitely large in contrast to the one with $(n-1)$ rotations. However, it turns out that the efficiency of energy extraction from black holes with $n$ rotations is enormously enhanced by MPP.

This problem has previously been studied extensively in the context of continuum spacetimes, beginning with the purely analytic work of Bondi in the spherically-symmetric Newtonian case, Michel in the spherically-symmetric general relativistic case, and Petrich, Shapiro and Teukolsky in the axially-symmetric general relativistic case relevant for spinning black holes. However, the purpose of the present work is to determine the effect of discretization of the underlying spacetime upon the mass/energy and momentum accretion rates, the overall morphology and characteristics of the accretion flow, and the drag force exerted on the black hole in the case of non-zero spin. In order to achieve this, we first develop a novel formulation of the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics that is more directly amenable to rigorous analysis within a discrete spacetime setting, and we then proceed to implement this formulation into the Gravitas computational general relativity framework. Through a combination of mathematical analysis and explicit numerical simulation in Gravitas, we discover that the mass/energy and momentum accretion rates both decrease monotonically as functions of the underlying spacetime discretization scale, with this effect becoming more pronounced for higher values of the black hole spin parameter, higher fluid temperatures, and stiffer equation of state parameters. We also find that the exerted drag force is highly sensitive to the value of the underlying discretization scale in the case of spinning black hole spacetimes, with certain instabilities becoming significantly more pronounced at certain critical values of the discretization parameter.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Also, when $1/2<q<1$, the $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ is close to the value of $1/2$, and finally when $0<q<1/2$, the values of $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ move away from the value of $1/2$, that is, they become smaller.

Near-horizon geometries and black hole thermodynamics in higher-derivative AdS$_5$ supergravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02215v2,"Pablo A. Cano, Marina David","Higher-derivative corrections in the AdS/CFT correspondence allow us to capture finer details of the dual CFT and to explore the holographic dictionary beyond the infinite N and strong coupling limits. Following an effective field theory approach, we investigate extremal AdS black hole solutions in five-dimensional supergravity with higher-derivative corrections. We provide a general analysis of near-horizon geometries of rotating extremal black holes and show how to obtain their corresponding charges and chemical potentials. We discuss the near-horizon solutions of the two-derivative theory, which we write using a novel parametrization that eases our computation of the higher-derivative corrections. The charges and thermodynamic properties of the black hole are computed while clarifying the ambiguities in their definitions. The charges and potentials turn out to satisfy a near-horizon version of the first law of thermodynamics whose interpretation we make clear. In the supersymmetric case, the results are shown to match the field theory prediction as well as previous results obtained from the on-shell action.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'black holes': 1}",02.2024,2024,02,"['Holography', 'Black Holes and GR']"
The dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of a binary flying closely by a Kerr supermassive black hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02178v1,"Zhongfu Zhang, Xian Chen","Recent astrophysical models predict that stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) could form and coalesce within a few gravitational radii of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Detecting the gravitational waves (GWs) from such systems requires numerical tools which can track the dynamics of the binaries while capturing all the essential relativistic effects. This work develops upon our earlier study of a BBH moving along a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a Kerr SMBH. Here we modify the numerical method to simulate a BBH falling toward the SMBH along a parabolic orbit of arbitrary inclination with respect to the equator. By tracking the evolution in a frame freely falling alongside the binary, we find that the eccentricity of the BBH is more easily excited than it is in the previous equatorial case, and that the cause is the asymmetry of the tidal tensor imposed on the binary when the binary moves out of the equatorial plane. Since the eccentricity reaches maximum around the same time that the BBH becomes the closest to the SMBH, multi-band GW bursts could be produced which are simultaneously detectable by the space- and ground-based detectors. We show that the effective spins of such GW events also undergo significant variation due to the rapid reorientation of the inner BBHs during their interaction with SMBHs. These results demonstrate the richness of three-body dynamics in the region of strong gravity, and highlight the necessity of building new numerical tools to simulate such systems.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The quasinormal modes of the black holes can be easily calculated in the framework of the Heun's equation. We identify three modes for the tensor perturbations: the photon sphere modes, which reduce to the quasinormal modes of Kerr black holes when the acceleration parameter vanishes; the near-extremal modes, which branch from the first set and become dominant when the spin is near extremal; and the acceleration modes, which are closely related to the acceleration horizon. We calculate the frequency spectrum of the QNMs in various spin and acceleration parameters. We choose an angular boundary condition that keeps the angular function regular at $ θ= 0 $ and $π$, which is consistent with the boundary condition of the Kerr black hole. The conical singularity caused by the acceleration influences this boundary condition. We find that the $m_0 = 1$ modes have an anomalous behavior at particular accelerations.",{'black holes': 3},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

This process is called transmon ionization (TI) and known to be detrimental to the qubit coherence and operation. In this work, we investigate the onset of TI in an irreversible, parametrically-driven, frequency conversion process in a system consisting of a superconducting 3D-cavity coupled to a fixed-frequency transmon qubit. Above a critical pump power we find a sudden increase in the transmon population. Using Renyi entropy, Floquet modes, and Husimi Q functions, we infer that this abrupt change can be attributed to a quantum-to-classical phase transition. Furthermore, in the context of the single-photon detection, we measure a TI-uncorrected detection efficiency of up to 86% and estimate a TI-corrected value of up to 78% by exploiting the irreversible frequency conversion. Our numerical simulations suggest that increasing the detuning between the pump and qubit frequencies and increasing the qubit anharmonicity can suppress the TI impact. Our findings highlight the general importance of the TI process when operating coupled qubit-cavity systems.",{'Renyi entropy': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Holography']
Efficient implementation of discrete-time quantum walks in NISQ devices,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01854v1,"Luca Razzoli, Gabriele Cenedese, Maria Bondani, Giuliano Benenti","Quantum walks have proven to be a universal model for quantum computation and to provide speed-up in certain quantum algorithms. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, among others, is one of the most suitable candidates for circuit implementation, due to its discrete nature. Current implementations, however, are usually characterized by quantum circuits of large size and depth, which severely limit the number of time steps that can be reliably implemented in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable quantum circuit implementing the DTQW on the $2^n$-cycle based on the diagonalization of the conditional shift operator. For $t$ time-steps of the DTQW, the proposed circuit requires only $O(n^2 + nt)$ two-qubit gates against the $O(n^2 t)$ of the current most efficient implementation based on quantum Fourier transforms. We test the proposed circuit on a IBM quantum device for a Hadamard DTQW on the $4$- and $8$-cycle characterized by periodic dynamics and recurrent generation of maximally entangled single-particle states. Experimental results are meaningful well beyond the regime of very few time steps, paving the way for reliable implementation and use on NISQ devices.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Relativity of the event: examples in JT gravity and linearized GR,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01847v1,"Francesco Nitti, Federico Piazza, Alexander Taskov","Observables in quantum gravity are famously defined asymptotically, at the boundary of AdS or Minkowski spaces. However, by gauge fixing a coordinate system or suitably dressing the field operators, an approximate, ""quasi-local"" approach is also possible, that can give account of the measurements performed by a set of observers living inside the spacetime. In particular, one can attach spatial coordinates to the worldlines of these observers and use their proper times as a time coordinate. Here we highlight that any such local formulation has to face the relativity of the event, in that changing frame (= set of observers) implies a reshuffling of the point-events and the way they are identified. As a consequence, coordinate transformations between different frames become probabilistic in quantum gravity. We give a concrete realization of this mechanism in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, where a point in the bulk can be defined operationally with geodesics anchored to the boundary. We describe different ways to do so, each corresponding to a different frame, and compute the variances of the transformations relating some of these frames. In particular, we compute the variance of the location of the black hole horizon, which appears smeared in most frames. We then suggest how to calculate this effect in Einstein gravity, assuming knowledge of the wavefunction of the metric. The idea is to expand the latter on a basis of semiclassical states. Each element of this basis enjoys standard/deterministic coordinate transformations and the result is thus obtained by superposition. As a divertissement, we sabotage the familiar Lorentz boosts by adding to Minkoswki spacetime a quantum superposition of gravitational waves and compute the probabilistic transformation to a boosted frame in linearized gravity. Finally, we attempt to translate the relativity of the event in the language of dressed operators.",{'geodesics': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

In this letter, we report the discovery of a massive protocluster around a luminous quasar at $z=6.63$. This protocluster is anchored by the quasar, and includes three [CII] emitters at $z\sim6.63$, 12 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) at $6.54<z\le6.64$, and a large number of narrow-band imaging selected LAE candidates at the same redshift.

An accurate quantification of its relevance is therefore mandatory. We present a study aimed at evaluating the importance of obscuration in high redshift jetted QSO, i.e. those active nuclei characterized by the presence of powerful relativistic jets. We compare the observed number of radio detected QSO at different radio flux density limits with the value predicted by the beaming model on the basis of the number of oriented sources (blazars). Any significant deficit of radio-detected QSO compared to the predictions can be caused by the presence of obscuration along large angles from the jet direction. We apply this method to two sizable samples characterized by the same optical limit (mag=21) but significantly different radio density limits (30 mJy and 1 mJy respectively) and containing a total of 87 independent radio-loud 4<z<6.8 QSO, 31 of which classified as blazars. We find a general good agreement between the numbers predicted by the model and those actually observed, with only a marginal discrepancy at 0.5 mJy that could be caused by the lack of completeness of the sample. We conclude that we have no evidence of obscuration within angles 10-20deg from the relativistic jet direction. We also show how the ongoing deep wide-angle radio surveys will be instrumental to test the presence of obscuration at much larger angles, up to 30-35deg. We finally suggest that, depending on the actual fraction of obscured QSO, relativistic jets could be much more common at high redshifts compared to what is usually observed in the local Universe",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

We explain this phenomenon by constructing a minimal model based on the confinement of elementary excitations, which take the form of various flavors of hadronic quasiparticles due to the unique structure of the lattice. Our model is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. For quenches to larger values of the transverse field and/or from non-symmetry broken states, our numerical results displays the expected signatures of thermalisation: a linear growth of entanglement entropy in time, propagation of correlations and the saturation of observables to their thermal averages.

We consider multiple configurations of the stretched horizons to which geometric objects are anchored. The holographic complexity proposals admit a hyperfast growth when the gravitational observables only lie in the cosmological patch, except for a class of complexity=anything observables that admit a linear growth. All the complexity conjectures present a linear increase when restricted to the black hole patch, similar to the AdS case. When both the black hole and the cosmological regions are probed, codimension-zero proposals are time-independent, while codimension-one proposals can have non-trivial evolution with linear increase at late times.

As one of the archetypal strongly correlated materials, vanadium dioxide (VO2) undergoes a structural phase transition (SPT) from a monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) structure and an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) either when heated above 340 K or when excited by an ultrafast laser pulse. Here, we present a tensor network study of the light-induced phase transitions in VO2 based on a quasi-one-dimensional model with all the important ingredients -- multi-orbital character, electron-lattice coupling, and electron-electron correlations -- being included. We show that this model qualitatively captures the equilibrium properties of VO2 by calculating the ground state phase diagram and finite-temperature phase transitions. A hybrid quantum-classical tensor-network method is used to simulate the dynamics following photoexcitation. We find that the structure can transform faster than the harmonic phonon modes of M1 phase, suggesting lattice nonlinearity is key in the SPT. We also find separate timescales for the evolution of dimerization and tilt distortions in the lattice dynamics, as well as the loss and subsequent partial restoration behavior of the displacements, which can provide an explanation for the complex dynamics observed in recent experiments [C. Brahms et al., arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX]. Moreover, decoupled SPT and IMT dynamics are observed in the numerical simulations: while the initial M1 structure transforms to the R one in tens of femtoseconds, the IMT occurs quasi-instantaneously, consistent with recent experimental findings.

Kadam","Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates.

Goldberg, Khabat Heshami","Quantum machine learning, focusing on quantum neural networks (QNNs), remains a vastly uncharted field of study. Current QNN models primarily employ variational circuits on an ansatz or a quantum feature map, often requiring multiple entanglement layers. This methodology not only increases the computational cost of the circuit beyond what is practical on near-term quantum devices but also misleadingly labels these models as neural networks, given their divergence from the structure of a typical feed-forward neural network (FFNN). Moreover, the circuit depth and qubit needs of these models scale poorly with the number of data features, resulting in an efficiency challenge for real-world machine-learning tasks. We introduce a bona fide QNN model, which seamlessly aligns with the versatility of a traditional FFNN in terms of its adaptable intermediate layers and nodes, absent from intermediate measurements such that our entire model is coherent. This model stands out with its reduced circuit depth and number of requisite C-NOT gates to outperform prevailing QNN models. Furthermore, the qubit count in our model remains unaffected by the data's feature quantity. We test our proposed model on various benchmarking datasets such as the diagnostic breast cancer (Wisconsin) and credit card fraud detection datasets. We compare the outcomes of our model with the existing QNN methods to showcase the advantageous efficacy of our approach, even with a reduced requirement on quantum resources.

Efficiently Separating the Source of the Teukolsky Equation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00604v3,Andrew Spiers,"Recent gravitational wave detections from black hole mergers have underscored the critical role black hole perturbation theory and the Teukolsky equation play in understanding the behaviour of black holes. The separable nature of the Teukolsky equation has long been leveraged to study the vacuum linear Teukolsky equation; however, as theory and measurements advance, solving the sourced Teukolsky equation is becoming a frontier of research. In particular, second-order calculations, such as in quasi-normal mode and self-force problems, have extended sources. This paper presents a novel method for efficiently separating the Teukolsky equation's source analytically, a non-trivial problem due to the angular and radial mixing of generic quantities in Kerr spacetime. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of our method's accuracy, separating the Teukolsky source produced by the stress-energy tensor of an ideal gas cloud surrounding a Kerr black hole. The detailed application of our method is provided in an accompanying \textit{Mathematica} notebook. Our approach opens up a new avenue for efficient, accurate black hole perturbation theory calculations with sources in both the time and frequency domain.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Small-scale clustering of Primordial Black Holes: cloud-in-cloud and exclusion effects,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00600v1,"Pierre Auclair, Baptiste Blachier","Using an excursion-set approach, we revisit the initial spatial clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) originating from the Hubble re-entry of large Gaussian density fluctuations in the early universe. We derive the two-point correlation functions of PBHs, properly accounting for the ""cloud-in-cloud"" mechanism. Our expressions naturally and intrinsically correlate the formation of pairs of PBHs, which is a key difference with the Poisson model of clustering. Our approach effectively includes short-range exclusion effects and clarifies the clustering behaviors at small scale: PBHs are anti-correlated at short distances. Using a scale-independent collapse threshold, we derive explicit expressions for the excess probability to find pairs of PBHs separated by a distance $r$, as well as the excess probability to find pairs with asymmetric mass ratio.

Many techniques exist for solving the quantum circuit mapping problem, many of which relate quantum circuit mapping to classical computer science. This work considers a novel perspective on quantum circuit mapping, in which the routing process of a simplified circuit is viewed as a composition of quantum operations acting on density matrices representing the quantum circuit and processor. Drawing on insight from recent advances in quantum information theory and information geometry, we show that a minimal SWAP gate count for executing a quantum circuit on a device emerges via the minimization of the distance between quantum states using the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. Additionally, we develop a novel initial placement algorithm based on a graph similarity search that selects the partition nearest to a graph isomorphism between interaction and coupling graphs. From these two ingredients, we then construct a polynomial-time algorithm for calculating the SWAP gate lower bound, which is directly compared alongside the IBM Qiskit compiler for over 600 realistic benchmark experiments, as well as against a brute-force method for smaller benchmarks. In our simulations, we unambiguously find that neither the brute-force method nor the Qiskit compiler surpass our bound, implying utility as a precise estimation of minimal overhead when realizing quantum algorithms on constrained quantum hardware. This work constitutes the first use of quantum circuit uncomplexity to practically-relevant quantum computing. We anticipate that this method may have diverse applicability outside of the scope of quantum information science, and we discuss several of these possibilities.","{'quantum circuit': 7, 'quantum information theory': 1}",02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Here, we take into account the anisotropic radiation feedback and the sublimation of dust grains. Our simulations show that when the relative velocity between the BH and the gas is small (~20 km/s) and gas density is ~10^4/cm^3, the gas mainly accretes from near the equatorial plane of the accretion disk at a time-averaged rate of 0.6% of the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. An ionized region like two spheres glued together at the equatorial plane is formed, and the dense shock shell appears near the ionization front. The BH is accelerated at ~10^-8cm/s^2 due to the gravity of the shell. For denser gas (~10^6/cm^3), the time-averaged accretion rate is also 0.6% of the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate.However, the BH is decelerated at ~10^-7cm/s^2 due to gravity of the dense downstream gas although the dense shock shell appears upstream. Our simulations imply that intermediate-mass BHs in the early universe keep floating at > several 10km/s without increasing mass in interstellar gas with density of ~10^4/cm^3, and slow down and grow into supermassive BHs in galaxies with the density of ~10^6/cm^3.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The data suggests a rapid decline in the density of dark matter beyond $19$~kpc. We fit the whole rotation curve with four components (gas, disk, bulge and halo) and compute the microlensing optical depth to the Large Magellanic Cloud. With this model of the galaxy we reanalyse the microlensing events of the MACHO and EROS-2 Collaborations. Using the published MACHO efficiency function for the duration of their survey, together with the rate of expected events according to the new density profile, we find that the Dark Matter halo could be composed up to $100\%$ of massive compact halo objects for any mass between $10^{-4}$ to $100~M_\odot$, except a broad range around $0.01~M_\odot$, where it cannot be larger than $\sim20~\%$. For the EROS-2 survey, using a modified efficiency curve for consistency with the MACHO analysis, we also find compatibility with a 100\% MACHO halo, but with a tighter constraint around $0.001~M_\odot$ where the halo fraction cannot be larger than $\sim12~\%$. This result assumes that MACHOs all have the same mass. If these were distributed in an extended mass function like that of the Thermal History Model, the constraints are weakened, allowing $100\%$ of all DM in the form of Primordial Black Holes.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Randomly Monitored Quantum Codes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00145v1,"Dongjin Lee, Beni Yoshida","Quantum measurement has conventionally been regarded as the final step in quantum information processing, which is essential for reading out the processed information but collapses the quantum state into a classical state. However, recent studies have shown that quantum measurement itself can induce novel quantum phenomena. One seminal example is a monitored random circuit, which can generate long-range entanglement faster than a random unitary circuit. Inspired by these results, in this paper, we address the following question: When quantum information is encoded in a quantum error-correcting code, how many physical qubits should be randomly measured to destroy the encoded information? We investigate this question for various quantum error-correcting codes and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for destroying the information through measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that for a large class of quantum error-correcitng codes, it is impossible to destroy the encoded information through random single-qubit Pauli measurements when a tiny portion of physical qubits is still unmeasured. Our results not only reveal the extraordinary robustness of quantum codes under measurement decoherence, but also suggest potential applications in quantum information processing tasks.",{'quantum error-correcting code': 1},02.2024,2024,02,"['Holography', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

The full solution includes the effect of the Chern-Simons induced charges and currents on the axion domain wall arising from the Witten and Sikivie (anomalous Hall) effects, respectively. The Euclidean solution has a reduced $O(2)\times O(2)$ symmetry which describes the nucleation of a prolate bubble in its rest-frame. A unique feature of this solution is that the region of lower energy density is outside the bubble rather than inside.

In theories with gravity we find a new form of non-invertible gauge symmetry that emerges in the limit of fundamental, tensionless strings. These stringy non-invertible gauge symmetries appear in standard examples such as non-abelian orbifolds. Moving away from the tensionless limit always breaks these symmetries. We also find that both the conventional form of non-invertible gauge symmetries and these stringy generalizations are realized in AdS/CFT. Although generically broken, approximate non-invertible symmetries have implications for Swampland constraints: in certain cases they can be used to prove the existence of towers of states related to the Distance Conjecture, and can sometimes explain the existence of slightly sub-extremal states which fill in the gaps in the sublattice Weak Gravity Conjecture.",{'AdS/CFT': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Holography']

[Nature \textbf{621}, 711 (2023)] reported that the jet nozzle of M87* exhibits a precession with a period of approximately 11 years. This finding strongly suggests that M87* is a spinning black hole with a tilted accretion disk. In this paper, our aim is to utilize these observations to constrain the parameters of the black hole. Firstly, we investigate the properties of the tilted circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits. The corresponding angular momentum, energy, and Carter constant for both prograde and retrograde orbits are calculated. We find that, compared to equatorial circular orbits, these quantities exhibit significant differences for fixed tilt angles. Moreover, the Carter constant takes positive values for nonvanishing tilt angles. Notably, the presence of misalignment of the orbit angular momentum and black hole spin leads to a precession effect in these tilted circular orbits. We then make use of these circular orbits to model the warp radius of the tilted accretion disk, which allows us to determine the corresponding precession period through the motion of massive particles. Further comparing with the observation of M87*, the relationship between the black hole spin and the warp radius is given, through which if one of them is tested, the other one will be effectively determined. Additionally, our study establishes an upper bound on the warp radius of the accretion disk.

The simplest generalization of Maxwell electrodynamics for Lyra manifolds is considered. It is presented an analytic solution for the line element of a Reissner-Nordström LyST generalization. It is shown that, due to the natural presence of a scale radius, it is possible to have three different extremal charges for positive or negative charge intervals. As a consequence, in natural units, the equality of the mass and charge defined on Lyra manifolds does not give rise to an extremal black hole, which allows the existence of solutions in which the charge is greater than the mass. An analysis with charged test particles indicates that a finite positive Lyra scale radius possibly allows for a violation of the weak cosmic censorship on Lyra manifolds, it is shown that an extremal black hole can be overcharged to the point that the emergence of a naked singularity becomes possible. The same behavior is observed for negative values of the Lyra radius if its absolute value is greater than four times the black hole mass.

The arguments in this derivation could lead to a novel picture of Lorentzian gravity as a quantum mechanical time uncertainty based on the holographic principle and classicalization.",{'tensor network': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Tensor Networks']
Detecting Measurement-Induced Entanglement Transitions With Unitary Mirror Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17367v1,"Yariv Yanay, Brian Swingle, Charles Tahan","Monitored random circuits, consisting of alternating layers of entangling two-qubit gates and projective single-qubit measurements applied to some fraction $p$ of the qubits, have been a topic of recent interest. In particular, the resulting steady state exhibits a phase transition from highly correlated states with &#34;volume-law&#34; entanglement at $p&lt;p_{c}$ to localized states with &#34;area-law&#34; entanglement at $p&gt;p_{c}$. It is hard to access this transition experimentally, as it cannot be seen at the ensemble level. Naively, to observe it one must repeat the experiment until the set of measurement results repeats itself, with likelihood that is exponentially small in the number of measurements. To overcome this issue, we present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm which creates a matrix product state (MPS) based &#34;unitary mirror&#34; of the projected circuit. Polynomial-sized tensor networks can represent quantum states with area-law entanglement, and so the unitary mirror can well-approximate the experimental state above $p_{c}$ but fails exponentially below it. The breaking of this mirror can thus pinpoint the critical point. We outline the algorithm and how such results would be obtained. We present a bound on the maximum entanglement entropy of any given state that is well-represented by an MPS, and from the bound suggest how the volume-law phase can be bounded. We consider whether the entanglement could similarly be bounded from below where the MPS fails. Finally, we present numerical results for small qubit numbers and for monitored circuits with random Clifford gates.",{'tensor networks': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Tensor Networks']
Inscribing geodesic circles on the face of the superstratum,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17366v1,"Bin Guo, Shaun D. Hampton, Nicholas P. Warner","We use families of circular null geodesics as probes of a family of microstate geometries, known as $(1,0,n)$ superstrata. These geometries carry a left-moving momentum wave and the behavior of some of the geodesic probes is very sensitive to this background wave. The left-moving geodesics behave like BPS particles and so can be placed in circular orbits anywhere in the geometry and actually ""float"" at fixed radius and angle in the three-dimensional ""capped BTZ"" geometry. The right-moving geodesics behave like non-BPS particles. We show that they provide a simple geometric characterization of the black-hole bound: when the momentum charge of the geometry is below this bound, such geodesics can be placed anywhere, but exceeding the bound, even by a small amount, means these geodesics are restricted to the deep interior of the geometry. We also show that for left-moving string probes, the tidal forces remain comparable with those of global AdS$_3$. Nevertheless, for some of these probes, the ""bumps"" in the geometry induce an oscillatory mass term and we discuss how this can lead to chaotic scrambling of the state of the string.",{'geodesics': 5},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Predicting the Heaviest Black Holes below the Pair Instability Gap,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17327v2,"Ethan R. J. Winch, Jorick S. Vink, Erin R. Higgins, Gautham N. Sabhahit","Traditionally, the pair instability (PI) mass gap is located between 50\,and 130\,$M_{\odot}$, with stellar mass black holes (BHs) expected to ""pile up"" towards the lower PI edge. However, this lower PI boundary is based on the assumption that the star has already lost its hydrogen (H) envelope. With the announcement of an ""impossibly"" heavy BH of 85\,$M_{\odot}$ as part of GW\,190521 located inside the traditional PI gap, we realised that blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors with small cores but large Hydrogen envelopes at low metallicity ($Z$) could directly collapse to heavier BHs than had hitherto been assumed. The question of whether a single star can produce such a heavy BH is important, independent of gravitational wave events. Here, we systematically investigate the masses of stars inside the traditional PI gap by way of a grid of 336 detailed MESA stellar evolution models calculated across a wide parameter space, varying stellar mass, overshooting, rotation, semi-convection, and $Z$. We evolve low $Z$ stars in the range $10^{-3} < Z / Z_{\odot} < Z_{\rm SMC}$, making no prior assumption regarding the mass of an envelope, but instead employing a wind mass loss recipe to calculate it. We compute critical Carbon-Oxygen and Helium core masses to determine our lower limit to PI physics, and we provide two equations for $M_{\text{core}}$ and $M_{\text{final}}$ that can also be of use for binary population synthesis. Assuming the H envelope falls into the BH, we confirm the maximum BH mass below PI is $M_{\text{BH}} \simeq 93.3$ $M_{\odot}$. Our grid allows us to populate the traditional PI gap, and we conclude that the distribution of BHs above the traditional boundary is not solely due to the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), but also to the same stellar interior physics (i.e. mixing) that which sets the BH maximum.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum inertia of non-local matterspace with kinetic and metric counter-stresses,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17321v1,I. E. Bulyzhenkov,"New microscopic geodesics with local balances of kinetic and metric four-potentials can maintain the non-local mass mechanism of continuous matterspace due to positive energies of kinetic micro-oscillations. The monistic pan-unity of the inertial continuum of kinetic energy is quantitatively substantiated by the Lomonosov local push on macroscopic densities in inverse square interactions of visible bodies. The monistic mechanics of inertial fields replaces the dual model of separated particles and their pulling fields or forces at a distance. The positive kinetic pressure of Poincare withstands the metric stress for equilibrium densities and prevents the radial collapse of non-local self-organizations, despite the observed fall of probe (extremely dense) densities in rarefied regions of the correlated continuum of the emerging mass-energy. The four-dimensional geometrization with the inherent sub-symmetries for flat matterspace and adaptive kinetic-metric time can be useful for modeling stationary and auto-pulsing astrosystems, as well as for the modeling of vortex hydrodynamics with non-local feedback and micro-macro-mega-entanglement in the monistic field of quantum inertia.",{'geodesics': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Massive black holes in nuclear star clusters: Investigation with SRG/eROSITA X-ray data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17288v2,"Nils Hoyer, Riccardo Arcodia, Silvia Bonoli, Andrea Merloni, Nadine Neumayer, Yi Zhang, Johan Comparat","Massive black holes (MBHs) are typically hosted in the centres of massive galaxies but they appear to become rarer in lower mass galaxies, where nuclear star clusters (NSCs) frequently appear instead. The transition region, where both an MBH and NSC can co-exist, has been poorly studied to date and only a few dozen galaxies are known to host them. One avenue for detecting new galaxies with both an MBH and NSC is to look for accretion signatures of MBHs. Here, we use new SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey eRASS:4 data to search for X-ray signatures of accreting MBHs in NSCs, while also investigating their combined occupation fraction. We find significant detections for 18 galaxies (~8.3%), including one ultra-luminous X-ray source; however, only three galaxies (NGC2903, 4212, and 4639) have X-ray luminosities that are higher than the expected value from X-ray binaries, indicative of the presence of an MBH. In addition, the X-ray luminosity of six galaxies (NGC2903, 3384, 4321, 4365, 4639, and 4701) differs from previous studies and could indicate the presence of a variable active galactic nucleus. The combined occupation fraction of accreting MBHs and NSCs becomes non-zero for galaxy masses above ~10^7.5 M_sun and this result is slightly elevated as compared to the literature data. Our data extend, for the first time, towards the dwarf elliptical galaxy regime and identify promising MBH candidates for higher resolution follow-up observations. At most galaxy masses (and with the exception of three cases), the X-ray constraints are consistent with the expected emission from binary systems or an Eddington fraction of at most 0.01%, assuming a black holes mass of 10^6.5 M_sun. This work confirms the known complexities in similar-type of studies, while providing the appealing alternative of using X-ray survey data of in-depth observations of individual targets with higher resolution instruments.",{'black holes': 2},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In this paper we address this issue using the structure function statistic to measure the variability at X-ray wavelengths of a sample of optically selected QSOs with available black hole masses and Eddington ratios. We present a new Bayesian methodology for estimating the structure function tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray data. This is applied to 15,548 SDSS DRQ16 QSOs with repeat observations in the XMM-Newton archive and/or the SRG/eROSITA All Sky Survey. The X-ray structure function monotonically increases to time intervals of about 10-15 years, suggesting a preference for scenarios in which instabilities of the accretion disk contribute to the X-ray variability on long timescales. Additionally, there is evidence that the amplitude of the stochastic X-ray flux variations rises with decreasing black hole mass and Eddington ratio. This finding imposes stringent constraints on empirical models of Active Galactic Nuclei variability derived from local samples, emphasizing the significance of high-redshift population studies for comprehending the stochastic flux variations in active black holes.",{'black holes': 2},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
X-ray AGNs with SRG/eROSITA: Multi-wavelength observations reveal merger triggering and post-coalescence circumnuclear blowout,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17277v1,"Robert W. Bickley, Sara L. Ellison, Mara Salvato, Samir Salim, David R. Patton, Andrea Merloni, Shoshannah Byrne-Mamahit, Leonardo Ferreira, Scott Wilkinson","Major mergers between galaxies are predicted to fuel their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), particularly after coalescence. However, determining the prevalence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in mergers remains a challenge, because AGN diagnostics are sensitive to details of the central structure (e.g., nuclear gas clouds, geometry and orientation of a dusty torus) that are partly decoupled from SMBH accretion. X-rays, expected to be ubiquitous among accreting systems, are detectable through non-Compton-thick screens of obscuring material, and thus offer the potential for a more complete assessment of AGNs in mergers. But, extant statistical X-ray studies of AGNs in mergers have been limited by either sparse, heterogeneous, or shallow on-sky coverage. We use new X-ray observations from the first SRG/eROSITA all-sky data release to characterize the incidence, luminosity, and observability of AGNs in mergers. Combining machine learning and visual classification, we identify 923 post-mergers in Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) imaging and select 4,565 interacting galaxy pairs (with separations <120 kpc and mass ratios within 1:10) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that galaxies with X-ray AGNs are 2.0+/-0.24 times as likely to be identified as post-mergers compared to non-AGN controls, and that post-mergers are 1.8+/-0.1 times as likely to host an X-ray AGN as non-interacting controls. A multi-wavelength census of X-ray, optical, and mid-IR-selected AGNs suggests a picture wherein the underlying AGN fraction increases during pair-phase interactions, that galaxy pairs within ~20 kpc become heavily obscured, and that the obscuration often clears post-coalescence.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work, we report the discovery of two further galaxies showing QPEs, eRO-QPE3 and eRO-QPE4, with the eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma observatory. Among the properties in common with those of known QPEs are: the thermal-like spectral shape in eruption (up to $kT\sim110-120$ eV) and quiescence ($kT\sim50-90$ eV) and its evolution during the eruptions (with a harder rise than decay); the lack of strong canonical signatures of active nuclei (from current optical, UV, infrared and radio data); and the low-mass nature of the host galaxies ($\log M_*\approx 9-10$) and their massive central black holes ($\log M_{\rm BH}\approx 5-7$). These discoveries also bring several new insights into the QPE population: i) eRO-QPE3 shows eruptions on top of a decaying quiescence flux, providing further evidence for a connection between QPEs and a preceding tidal disruption event; ii) eRO-QPE3 exhibits the longest recurrence times and faintest peak luminosity of QPEs, compared to the known QPE population, excluding a correlation between the two; iii) we find evidence, for the first time, of a transient component that is harder, albeit much fainter, than the thermal QPE spectrum in eRO-QPE4; and iv) eRO-QPE4 displays the appearance (or significant brightening) of the quiescence disk component after the detection of QPEs, supporting its short-lived nature against a preexisting active galactic nucleus. Overall, the newly discovered properties (e.g., recent origin and/or transient nature of the quiescent accretion disk; lack of correlation between eruption recurrence timescales and luminosity) are qualitatively consistent with recent models that identify QPEs as extreme mass-ratio inspirals.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Partial tidal disruptions of spinning eccentric white dwarfs by spinning intermediate mass black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17031v1,"Debojyoti Garain, Tapobrata Sarkar","Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs, $\sim 10^2-10^5M_{\odot}$) are often dubbed as the missing link between stellar mass ($\lesssim 10^2M_{\odot}$) and super-massive ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} M_{\odot}$) black holes. Observational signatures of these can result from tidal disruption of white dwarfs (WDs), which would otherwise be captured as a whole by super-massive black holes. Recent observations indicate that IMBHs might be rapidly spinning, while it is also known that isolated white dwarfs might have large spins, with spin periods of the order of minutes. Here, we aim to understand the effects of ``coupling'' between black hole and stellar spin, focussing on the tidal disruption of spinning WDs in the background of spinning IMBHs. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we perform a suite of numerical simulations of partial tidal disruptions, where spinning WDs are in eccentric orbits about spinning IMBHs. We take a hybrid approach, where we integrate the Kerr geodesic equations while being in a regime where we can treat the internal stellar fluid dynamics in the Newtonian limit. We find substantial effects of the ``coupling'' between the black hole spin and the spin of the white dwarf, although the pericenter distance of the white dwarf is taken to be large enough so that the Newtonian limit of its fluid dynamics is a robust approximation. In particular, the core mass, the bound tail mass, and the mass difference between the two tidal tails strongly depend on such ``coupled'' spin effects. However, the late time fallback rate of the debris behaves similar to the non-spinning cases. We also compute gravitational wave amplitudes and find that while the black hole spin influences the same, there is no evidence of influence of stellar spin on such amplitudes in our regime of interest.",{'black holes': 3},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Here we introduce deep hybrid classical-quantum reservoir computing for temporal processing of quantum states where information about, for instance, the entanglement or the purity of past input states can be extracted via a single-step measurement. We find that the hybrid setup cascading two reservoirs not only inherits the strengths of both of its constituents but is even more than just the sum of its parts, outperforming comparable non-hybrid alternatives.

At all times we need a Hilbert space of a finite dimension, as long as particles far separated from the black hole are ignored.

For charged static black holes, we work in two different ensembles: fixed charge$(q)$ ensemble and fixed potential$(φ)$ ensemble. For charged, rotating black hole, four different types of ensembles are considered: fixed $(q, J)$, fixed $(φ, J)$, fixed $(q,Ω)$ and fixed $(φ,Ω)$ ensemble, where $J$ and $Ω$ denotes the angular momentum and the angular frequency respectively. Using the generalized off-shell free energy method, where the black holes are treated as topological defects in their thermodynamic spaces, we investigate the local and global topology of these black holes via the computation of winding numbers at these defects. For static black hole we work in three model. We find that the topological charge for a static black hole is always $-1$ regardless of the values of the thermodynamic parameters and the choice of $f(R)$ model. For a charged static black hole, in the fixed charge ensemble, the topological charge is found to be zero. Contrastingly, in the fixed $φ$ ensemble, the topological charge is found to be $-1.$ For charged static black holes, in both the ensembles, the topological charge is observed to be independent of the thermodynamic parameters. For charged, rotating black hole, in fixed $(q, J)$ ensemble, the topological charge is found to be $1.$ In $(φ, J)$ ensemble, we find the topological charge to be $1.$ In case of fixed $(q,Ω)$ ensemble, the topological charge is $1$ or $0$ depending on the value of the scalar curvature($R$).

A Novel Scalable Quantum Protocol for the Dining Cryptographers Problem,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16679v1,"Peristera Karananou, Theodore Andronikos","This paper presents an innovative entanglement-based protocol to address the Dining Cryptographers Problem, utilizing maximally entangled $\ket{ GHZ_{ n } }$ tuples as its core. This protocol aims to provide scalability in terms of both the number of cryptographers $n$ and the amount of anonymous information conveyed, represented by the number of qubits $m$ within each quantum register. The protocol supports an arbitrary number of cryptographers $n$, enabling scalability in both participant count and the volume of anonymous information transmitted. While the original Dining Cryptographers Problem focused on a single bit of information, i.e., whether a cryptographer paid for dinner, the proposed protocol allows $m$, the number of qubits in each register, to be any arbitrarily large positive integer. This flexibility permits the conveyance of various information, such as the cost of the dinner or the timing of the arrangement. Another noteworthy aspect of the introduced protocol is its versatility in accommodating both localized and distributed versions of the Dining Cryptographers problem. The localized scenario involves all cryptographers gathering physically at the same location, such as a restaurant, simultaneously. In contrast, the distributed scenario accommodates cryptographers situated in different places, engaging in a virtual dinner at the same time. Finally, in terms of implementation, the protocol ensures uniformity by requiring all cryptographers to utilize identical private quantum circuits. This design establishes a completely modular quantum system where all modules are identical.

In this work, we propose a quantum circuit-based algorithm to implement quantum residual neural networks (QResNets), where the residual connection channels are constructed by introducing auxiliary qubits to the data-encoding and trainable blocks of the quantum neural networks. Importantly, we prove that when this particular network architecture is applied to a $l$-layer data-encoding, the number of frequency generation forms can be extended from one, namely the difference of the sum of generator eigenvalues, to $\mathcal{O}(l^2)$. And the flexibility in adjusting the corresponding Fourier coefficients can also be improved due to the diversity of spectrum construction methods and the additional optimization degrees of freedom in the generalized residual operators. These results indicate that the residual encoding scheme can achieve better spectral richness and enhance the expressivity of various parameterized quantum circuits. Extensive numerical demonstrations in regression tasks of fitting various functions and applications in image classification with MNIST datasets are offered to present the expressivity enhancement.

Particle dynamics in spherically symmetric electro-vacuum instantons,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15809v1,Arthur Garnier,"In this paper, we study the geodesic motion in spherically symmetric electro-vacuum Euclidean solutions of the Einstein equation.

First, we derive the motion equations for the ERN spacetime and we generalize the results of Battista-Esposito, showing that all orbits in as ERN spacetime are unbounded if and only if it has an event horizon. We also obtain the Weierstrass form of the polar radial motion, providing an efficient tool for numerical computations. We then study the angular deflection of orbits in the Euclidean Schwarzschild spacetime which, in contrast to the Lorentzian background, can be either positive or negative. We observe the presence of a null and a maximal deflection rings for particles with velocity at infinity $v>1$ and we give approximate values for their size when $v\gtrsim1$. For BR spacetimes, we obtain analytic solutions for the radial motion in proper length, involving (hyperbolic) trigonometric functions and we deduce that orbits either exponentially go to the singularity or are periodic.

Notably, multi-beam multi-wavelength holographic systems represent an important development direction for advanced volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM). Nonetheless, searching for the optimal 3D holographic projection is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the physical constraints involved. This work introduces an optimization framework to search for the optimal set of projection parameters, namely phase modulation values and amplitudes, for multi-beam holographic lithography. The proposed framework is more general than classical phase retrieval algorithms in the sense that it can simultaneously optimize multiple holographic beams and model the coupled non-linear material response created by co-illumination of the holograms. The framework incorporates efficient methods to evaluate holographic light fields, resample quantities across coordinate grids, and compute the coupled exposure effect. The efficacy of this optimization method is tested for a variety of setup configurations that involve multi-wavelength illumination, two-photon absorption, and time-multiplexed scanning beam. A special test case of holo-tomographic patterning optimized 64 holograms simultaneously and achieved the lowest error among all demonstrations. This variant of tomographic VAM shows promises for achieving high-contrast microscale fabrication. All testing results indicate that a fully coupled optimization offers superior solutions relative to a decoupled optimization approach.",{'holography': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']

Non-parametric Greedy Optimization of Parametric Quantum Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15442v1,"Koustubh Phalak, Swaroop Ghosh","The use of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) that are analogous to classical neural networks, has greatly increased in the past decade owing to the growing interest in the field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). A QNN consists of three major components: (i) data loading/encoding circuit, (ii) Parametric Quantum Circuit (PQC), and (iii) measurement operations. Under ideal circumstances the PQC of the QNN trains well, however that may not be the case for training under quantum hardware due to presence of different kinds of noise. Deeper QNNs with high depths tend to degrade more in terms of performance compared to shallower networks. This work aims to reduce depth and gate count of PQCs by replacing parametric gates with their approximate fixed non-parametric representations. We propose a greedy algorithm to achieve this such that the algorithm minimizes a distance metric based on unitary transformation matrix of original parametric gate and new set of non-parametric gates. From this greedy optimization followed by a few epochs of re-training, we observe roughly 14% reduction in depth and 48% reduction in gate count at the cost of 3.33% reduction in inferencing accuracy. Similar results are observed for a different dataset as well with different PQC structure.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'quantum machine learning': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Rosa","Massive perturbations in asymptotic flat black holes leave a distinct signature in their late-time evolution `tail': an oscillatory behavior modulated by the Compton wavelength of the field, which can be associated with the so-called quasibound state spectrum. In asymptotically de-Sitter spacetimes, however, the massive perturbations always leak to the cosmological horizon, which indicates the absence of a quasibound part of the spectrum. In this work, we show that an additional mode exists in asymptotically de-Sitter black holes that produces an imprint similar to that of the quasibound states in the late-time behavior of massive scalar perturbations. If the Compton wavelength is larger than a certain critical value (which depends on the cosmological constant), the oscillatory behavior of the tail turns into an exponential decay due to the fact that the de-Sitter mode is purely imaginary. Even for black holes with typical length scales small in comparison to the size of the cosmological horizon, the late-time tail behavior of the massive perturbations is modified as compared to the usual $t^{-5/6}$ for Schwarzschild black holes, thus being a distinctive feature induced by the presence of a cosmological constant.",{'black holes': 4},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes in Horndeski Theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15143v1,"Matteo Magi, Jaiyul Yoo","Cosmological probes constructed in large-scale surveys are independent of the underlying theory of gravity, and their relativistic descriptions are indeed applicable to any theory of gravity. It was shown that the presence of fluctuations with wavelength much larger than the characteristic scales of the surveys has no impact on cosmological probes, if the matter content is adiabatic and the Einstein equations are used. In this paper we study the sensitivity of cosmological probes to infrared fluctuations in Horndeski theory. We find that the extra degree of freedom in the Horndeski scalar field can induce sensitivity to infrared fluctuations in the cosmological probes, even when the matter components are adiabatic on large scales. A generalized adiabatic condition including the extra dof, in contrast, guarantees that cosmological probes are devoid of infrared sensitivity, and this solution corresponds to the adiabatic modes à la Weinberg in Horndeski theory, which can be removed by a coordinate transformation in the infrared limit.

This work provides the horizon structure, photon radius and inner stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a mass particle with EYM BH parameters. An analysis is provided of the effective potential as well as the possible orbits for test particles under various EYM BH parameters values. In timelike radial geodesics, we find that for smaller values of magnetic charge, particles following a timelike radial geodesic are hastier in EYM BH, and hence arrive at the center faster than those traveling a Schwarzschild BH geodesic. However, at larger values of the magnetic charge, the inverse effect is observed. The effect of model parameters is investigated in order to study the ISCO, photon radius, orbit stability (Lyapunov exponent), and effective force on particles for the BH in the EYM theory.

The resulting black hole is surrounded by a ``cloud"" of particles whose wave function populates the superradiant energy level of the black hole. For comparable mass ratio binary black hole systems, it has been suggested that these clouds are mostly depleted at large binary separations because of a resonant level mixing effect. As a result, these clouds may not be dynamically relevant for black hole and neutron star binaries that enter the LIGO and LISA detection frequency band. In this work, we point out that the common envelope process during a compact binary evolution may bring the binary to $\sim 0.01$AU in hundreds to thousands of years, so that the resonant level mixing of hyperfine levels are no longer important. We derive a relevant regime of binary parameters where the clouds are still present for binary entering the LISA band.

Our investigation reveals that the shadows of LQG modified black holes are smaller and brighter than Schwarzschild black holes. To examine the impact of the quantum correction on the quasinormal mode, linear-quadratic GUP modified black holes are explored under scalar and electromagnetic field perturbation. Here, linear-quadratic GUP is used to capture quantum corrections. It is observed that the incorporation of quantum correction by linear-quadratic GUP alters the singularity structure of the black hole. To compute the quasinormal modes of this linear-quadratic GUP-inspired quantum-corrected black holes, we compute the effective potential generated under the perturbation of scalar and electromagnetic field, and then we use the sixth-order WKB approach in conjunction with the appropriate numerical analysis. We find that the greybody factor decreases with the GUP parameter $α$ implying that the probability of transmission decreases with the GUP parameter.

Hard Attention Mechanism (HAM), anticipated to efficiently tackle the above QML bottlenecks, encounters the substantial challenge of non-differentiability, consequently constraining its extensive applicability. In response to the dilemma of HAM and QML, a Grover-inspired Quantum Hard Attention Mechanism (GQHAM) consisting of a Flexible Oracle (FO) and an Adaptive Diffusion Operator (ADO) is proposed. Notably, the FO is designed to surmount the non-differentiable issue by executing the activation or masking of Discrete Primitives (DPs) with Flexible Control (FC) to weave various discrete destinies. Based on this, such discrete choice can be visualized with a specially defined Quantum Hard Attention Score (QHAS).

Experimental findings demonstrate that GQHAN adeptly surmounts the non-differentiability hurdle, surpassing the efficacy of extant quantum soft self-attention mechanisms in accuracies and learning ability. In noise experiments, GQHAN is robuster to bit-flip noise in accuracy and amplitude damping noise in learning performance.

The high density of self-annihilating WIMPs in these spikes leads to copious gamma-ray production. Sufficiently nearby IMBHs could therefore appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources. However, the number of IMBHs and their distribution within our own Milky Way is currently unknown. In this work, we provide a mock catalogue of IMBHs and their dark matter spikes obtained from the EAGLE simulations, in which black holes with a mass of $10^5 \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ are seeded into the centre of halos greater than $10^{10} \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ to model black hole feedback influencing the formation of galaxies.

Interplay Between Neutrino Kicks and Hydrodynamic Kicks of Neutron Stars and Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13817v1,"H. -Thomas Janka, Daniel Kresse","Neutron stars (NSs) are observed with high space velocities and elliptical orbits in binaries. The magnitude of these effects points to natal kicks that originate from asymmetries during the supernova (SN) explosions. Using a growing set of long-time 3D SN simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, we explore the interplay of NS kicks that are induced by asymmetric neutrino emission and by asymmetric mass ejection. Anisotropic neutrino emission can arise from a large-amplitude dipolar convection asymmetry inside the proto-NS (PNS) termed LESA (Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry), which determines the kicks of NSs born from stars near the low-mass end of SN progenitors. In more massive progenitors aspherical accretion downflows around the PNS can also lead to anisotropic neutrino emission (absorption) with a neutrino-induced NS kick roughly opposite to (aligned with) the kick by asymmetric mass ejection. We estimate upper bounds for the final neutrino kicks of 150-260 km/s, whereas the hydrodynamic kicks can reach up to more than 1300 km/s. Therefore the hydrodynamic kicks dominate for NSs from explosions of higher-mass progenitors, whereas the neutrino kicks dominate in the case of NSs from the lowest-mass progenitors. Our models suggest that the Crab pulsar as a representative of the latter category could have received its velocity of about 160 km/s by a neutrino kick due to the LESA asymmetry. Such neutrino kicks of 100-200 km/s define a nearly ubiquitous floor value, which may shed new light on the origin of pulsars in globular clusters.

Siddiqui, Kaitlin Gili, Chris Ballance","Quantum hardware is progressing at a rapid pace and, alongside this progression, it is vital to challenge the capabilities of these machines using functionally complex algorithms. Doing so provides direct insights into the current capabilities of modern quantum hardware and where its breaking points lie. Stress testing is a technique used to evaluate a system by giving it a computational load beyond its specified thresholds and identifying the capacity under which it fails. We conduct a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the Quantinuum H1 ion trap device using a stress test based protocol. Specifically, we utilize the quantum machine learning algorithm, the Quantum Neuron Born Machine, as the computationally intensive load for the device. Then, we linearly scale the number of repeat-until-success subroutines within the algorithm to determine the load under which the hardware fails and where the failure occurred within the quantum stack. Using this proposed method, we assess the hardware capacity to manage a computationally intensive QML algorithm and evaluate the hardware performance as the functional complexity of the algorithm is scaled. Alongside the quantitative performance results, we provide a qualitative discussion and resource estimation based on the insights obtained from conducting the stress test with the QNBM.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In particular, it can be useful to observe solitary neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes, providing a unique window through which to understand stellar evolution. Obtaining direct mass measurements with this technique requires precise observations of both the change in brightness and the position of the microlensed star and the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite can provide both. We analysed events published in Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) microlensing catalogue using publicly available data from different surveys. Here we describe our selection of candidate dark lenses, where we suspect the lens is a white dwarf (WD), a neutron star (NS), a black hole (BH), or a mass-gap object, with a mass in a range between the heaviest NS and the least massive BH. We estimated the mass of the lenses using information obtained from the best-fitting microlensing models, the Galactic model and the expected distribution of the parameters.

Black hole masses ($\log\left(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\right)\sim7.5-9.5$) are available from previous spectroscopic campaigns. We extract the host galaxy components from four NIRCam broadband images and the HST/ACS F814W image by applying a 2D image decomposition technique. We detect the host galaxy for $\sim90\%$ of the sample after subtracting the unresolved AGN emission. With host photometry free of AGN emission, we determine the stellar mass of the host galaxies to be $\log\left(M_*/M_\odot\right)\sim10-11.5$ through SED fitting and measure the evolution of the mass relation between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Considering selection biases and measurement uncertainties, we find that the $M_\mathrm{ BH}/M_*$ ratio evolves as $\left(1+z\right)^{0.37_{-0.60}^{+0.35}}$ thus remains essentially constant or exhibits mild evolution up to $z\sim2.5$. We also see an amount of scatter ($σ_μ=0.28\pm0.13$) is similar to the local relation and consistent with low-$z$ studies; this appears to not rule out non-causal cosmic assembly where mergers contribute to the statistical averaging towards the local relation.

The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the study of massive black holes (MBHs, $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{6-7} \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$) up to $z\sim 11$, thus bridging the properties of $z\sim 6$ quasars to their ancestors. JWST spectroscopic observations of GN-z11, a well-known $z=10.6$ star forming galaxy, have been interpreted with the presence of a super-Eddington (Eddington ratio $\equiv \,λ_{\rm Edd}\sim 5.5$) accreting MBH. To test this hypothesis we use a zoom-in cosmological simulation of galaxy formation and BH co-evolution. We first test the simulation results against the observed probability distribution function (PDF) of $λ_{\rm Edd}$ found in $z\sim 6$ quasars. Then, we select in the simulation those BHs that satisfy the following criteria: (a) $10 < z < 11 $, (b) $M_{\rm BH} > 10^6 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Finally we apply the Extreme Value Statistics to the PDF of $λ_{\rm Edd}$ resulting from the simulation and find that the probability of observing a $z\sim 10-11$ MBH, accreting with $λ_{\rm Edd} \sim 5.5$, in the volume surveyed by JWST, is very low ($<0.5\%$). We compare our predictions with those in the literature and further discuss the main limitations of our work. Our simulation cannot explain the JWST observations of GN-z11.

The dominant contribution to the path integral comes from an Euclidean rotating black hole solution of the supergravity theory with a finite area event horizon, but the logarithm of the index, computed from the saddle point, vanishes. Nevertheless we show that the solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon where higher derivative corrections can be important, and once the higher derivative corrections are taken into account the solution could yield a finite result for the logarithm of the index whose form agrees with the microscopic results up to an overall numerical constant.

Transport and information in open quantum systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13292v1,Kasper Poulsen,"With the approaching second quantum revolution, the study of quantum thermodynamics, particularly heat flow, has become even more relevant for two main reasons. First, understanding heat and other types of noise is essential for protecting quantum information and preventing decoherence. Second, the ability to manufacture and control quantum systems developed for the quantum computer allows for experimental study of quantum thermodynamics in entirely new settings.
  In this thesis, several systems involving quantum systems in contact with baths are studied theoretically in experimentally available settings. First, two rectification or diode setups for heat currents are proposed using a dark-state mechanism. In one system, the dark-state mechanism is imperfect but very robust. In the other system, the dark-state mechanism relies on quantum entanglement and is much better but more fragile towards decoherence. Next, a quantum version of the Wheatstone bridge is built using the same entanglement-powered dark state mechanism. After having studied several boundary-driven quantum systems, the lessons learned are generalized into resonance conditions using a general linear chain of weakly interacting chains of strongly interacting spins.
  The final two chapters focus on the ability to study statistical physics in realizable quantum systems. First, a Maxwell's demon setup is proposed. A demon-controlled qutrit is coupled to two non-Markovian baths. The information back-flow from the non-Markovian baths allows the demon to more effectively transfer heat from the cold bath to the hot bath. Second, the Mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in a lattice of transmons is examined. The ground state has a variable particle number and is prepared using adiabatic state preparation.

Chen, Joel Leja, Qingling Ni, Guang Yang","A fundamental question in galaxy and black-hole evolution remains how galaxies and their supermassive black holes have evolved together over cosmic time. Specifically, it is still unclear how the position of X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies with respect to the star-forming main sequence (MS) may change with the X-ray luminosity ($L_\mathrm{X}$) of the AGN or the stellar mass ($M_\star$) of the host galaxy. We use data from XMM-SERVS to probe this issue. XMM-SERVS is covered by the largest medium-depth X-ray survey (with superb supporting multiwavelength data) and thus contains the largest sample to date for study. To ensure consistency, we locally derive the MS from a large reference galaxy sample. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the turnover of the galaxy MS does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn for high-mass AGNs, and we establish a robust safe regime where the results do not depend upon the choice of MS definition. Under this framework, our results indicate that less-massive AGN host-galaxies ($\log M_\star\sim9.5-10.5$ $M_\odot$) generally possess enhanced SFRs compared to their normal-galaxy counterparts while the more-massive AGN host galaxies ($\log M_\star\sim10.5-11.5$ $M_\odot$) lie on or below the star-forming MS. Further, we propose an empirical model for how the placement of an AGN with respect to the MS (SFR$_{norm}$) evolves as a function of both $M_\star$ and $L_\mathrm{X}$.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In this paper, we advocate the existence of a general single-field consistency relation that relates the amplitude of non-Gaussianity in the squeezed limit $f_{\text{NL}}$ to the power spectrum and remains valid when almost all other consistency relations are violated. In particular, it is suitable for studying scenarios where scale invariance is strongly violated. We discuss the general and model-independent consequences of the consistency relation on the behavior of $f_{\text{NL}}$ at different scales. Specifically, we study the size, sign and slope of $f_{\text{NL}}$ at the scales where the power spectrum peaks and argue that generally the peaks of $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the power spectrum occur at different scales.

As a consequence, it is not sufficient to rely solely on the analysis of such scalars to assess the regularity of a given space-time. This conclusion follows from the analysis of incomplete geodesics within the internal region of asymmetric wormholes supported by scalar matter which arise in two distinct metric-affine gravity theories. These wormholes have bounded algebraic curvature scalars everywhere, which highlights that their finiteness does not prevent the emergence of pathologies (singularities) in the geodesic structure of space-time. By analyzing the tidal forces in the internal wormhole region, we find that the angular components are unbounded along incomplete radial time-like geodesics. The strength of the singularity is determined by the evolution of Jacobi fields along such geodesics, finding that it is of strong type, as volume elements are torn apart as the singularity is approached.

Pop III stars have different structures from the current generation of stars and are important for generating heavy elements and shaping subsequent star formation. However, it is very challenging to directly detect Pop III stars given their high redshifts and short lifetimes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature for detecting Pop III stars through their tidal disruption events (TDEs) by massive black holes. We model the emission properties and calculate the expected rates for these unique TDEs in the early Universe at z ~ 10. We find that Pop III star TDEs have much higher mass fallback rates compared to normal TDEs in the local universe and are therefore rather luminous, rendering them feasible for detection. They also have very long observed flare evolution timescale, making it more likely to detect such TDEs during their rising phase. We further demonstrate that a large fraction of the TDE emissions are redshifted to infrared wavelengths and can be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Lastly, the TDE rate sensitively depends on the black hole mass function in the early Universe.

Our NIRSpec/IFU observations spatially resolve the emission line properties across the host galaxy in great detail. We find at least five concentrations of line emission, coinciding with discrete continuum features previously detected in imaging from HST and JWST, over an extent of ~2'' (~15 kpc). The spectral diagnostics enabled by NIRSpec unambiguously trace the activity of the obscured AGN plus interaction between the interstellar medium and the radio jet as the dominant mechanisms for the ionization state and kinematics of the gas in the system. A secondary region of very high ionization lies at roughly 5 kpc distance from the nucleus, and within the context of an expanding cocoon enveloping the radio lobe, this may be explained by strong shock-ionization of the entrained gas. However, it could also signal the presence of a second obscured AGN, which may also offer an explanation for an intriguing outflow feature seen perpendicular to the radio axis.

Information Problem in Black Holes and Cosmology and Ghosts in Quadratic Gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12191v1,Igor Volovich,"Black hole information problem is the question about unitarity of the evolution operator during the collapse and evaporation of the black hole. One can ask the same question about unitarity of quantum and inflationary cosmology. In this paper we argue that in both cases, for black holes and for cosmology, the answer is negative and we face non-unitarity.
  Such a question can not be addressed by using the fixed classical gravitational background since one has to take into account the backreaction. To his end one uses the semi-classical gravity, which includes the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator of the matter fields. One has to renormalize the energy-momentum tensor and one gets an effective action which contains quadratic terms in scalar curvature and Ricci tensor. Such quadratic gravity contains ghosts which in fact lead to violation of unitarity in black holes and cosmology. We discuss the question whether black holes will emit ghosts.
  One can try to restrict ourselves to the $f(R)$ gravity that seems is a good approximation to the semi-classical gravity and widely used in cosmology. The black hole entropy in $f(R)$ gravity is different from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and from entanglement island entropy. The black hole entropy in $R+R^2$ gravity goes to a constant during the evaporation process. This can be interpreted as another indication to the possible non-unitarity in black holes and cosmology",{'black holes': 4},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In particular, in combination with materials exhibiting high Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, SOTs are considered to result in well-controlled deterministic magnetisation dynamics and are, therefore, used as robust drives to move and create magnetic skyrmions. In contrast to these expectations, we here find unpredictable, transiently chaotic dynamics induced by SOT at an artificial anisotropy-engineered defect in a magnetic racetrack. Based on these controlled conditions, we directly observe the nanoscale dynamics with holography-based, time-resolved x-ray imaging. In concert with micromagnetic simulations, we disclose a regime of violent picosecond fluctuations, including topological instabilities that, remarkably, result in deterministic final configurations. In addition, our images expose previously unseen skyrmion shedding and highlight the potential of transiently chaotic pathways for topological switching.

Using the inspiral signals, we can probe the properties of the massive black holes, such as the spin-induced multipole moments. By verifying the relation among the mass, spin and quadrupole moment, the no-hair theoreom can be tested. In this work, we analysed the capability on probing the spin-induced quadrupole moment with the inspiral signal of massive black hole binaries using space-borne gravitational wave detectors. Using the Fisher information matrix, we find that the deviation of quadrupole moment can be constrained to the level of $10^{-1}$, and the events with higher mass-ratio will give a better constraint. We also find that the late inspiral part will dominate the result of parameter estimation. The result of Bayesian analysis shows that the capability will be improved by a few times due to the consideration of higher modes.

We consider and analyze different scenarios based on how many particles are accessible. In each scenario, we evaluate first-order coherence, concurrence fill, and global concurrence under varying Hawking temperature and Dirac particle mode frequency. For the fully accessible scenario with all particles outside the event horizon, the measures exhibit non-monotonic behavior with a discernible trade-off. In the partially accessible scenarios with one particle inside the event horizon, monotonic variations and clear trade-offs are observed. Finally, in the scenario when two particles are inside the event horizon, concurrence fill becomes complex, attributed to the violation of the entanglement polygon inequality in curved space-time. This result reveals intricate relationships between entanglement and coherence around the event horizon of Schwarzchild black holes.

Quantum Architecture Search with Unsupervised Representation Learning,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11576v1,"Yize Sun, Zixin Wu, Yunpu Ma, Volker Tresp","Utilizing unsupervised representation learning for quantum architecture search (QAS) represents a cutting-edge approach poised to realize potential quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Most QAS algorithms combine their search space and search algorithms together and thus generally require evaluating a large number of quantum circuits during the search process. Predictor-based QAS algorithms can alleviate this problem by directly estimating the performance of circuits according to their structures. However, a high-performance predictor generally requires very time-consuming labeling to obtain a large number of labeled quantum circuits. Recently, a classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec inspires us by showing that architecture search can benefit from decoupling unsupervised representation learning from the search process. Whether unsupervised representation learning can help QAS without any predictor is still an open topic. In this work, we propose a framework QAS with unsupervised representation learning and visualize how unsupervised architecture representation learning encourages quantum circuit architectures with similar connections and operators to cluster together. Specifically, our framework enables the process of QAS to be decoupled from unsupervised architecture representation learning so that the learned representation can be directly applied to different downstream applications. Furthermore, our framework is predictor-free eliminating the need for a large number of labeled quantum circuits. During the search process, we use two algorithms REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to directly search on the latent representation, and compare them with the method Random Search. The results show our framework can more efficiently get well-performing candidate circuits within a limited number of searches.",{'quantum circuit': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Quantum-enhanced Green&#39;s function Monte Carlo for excited states of nuclear shell model,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11521v1,"Yongdan Yang, Ruyu Yang, Xiaosi Xu","We present a hybrid quantum-classical Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) algorithm for estimating the excited states of the nuclear shell model. The conventional GFMC method, widely used to find the ground state of a quantum many-body system, is plagued by the sign problem, which leads to an exponentially increasing variance with the growth of system size and evolution time. This issue is typically mitigated by applying classical constraints but at the cost of introducing bias. Our approach uses quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) on a quantum computer to prepare a quantum trial state, replacing the classical trial state in the GFMC process. We also incorporated a modified classical shadow technique in the implementation of QSD to optimize quantum resource utilization. Besides, we extend our hybrid GFMC algorithm to find the excited states of a given quantum system.

However, when a test particle is dropped in, there exists a possibility in the near-extremal condition where the event horizon of the black hole can be destroyed. Overall, our analysis suggests that the presence of a dark matter halo hinders the super-spinning of black holes, implying that cold dark matter seems to play a protective role.

Moving Interfaces and two-dimensional Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11451v1,"Parthajit Biswas, Suchetan Das, Anirban Dinda","Conformal field theories can exchange energy through a boundary interface. Imposing conformal boundary conditions for static interfaces implies energy conservation at the interface. Recently, the reflective and transmitive properties of such static conformal interfaces have been studied in two dimensions by scattering matter at the interface impurity. In this note, we generalize this to the case of dynamic interfaces. Motivated by the connections between the moving mirror and the black hole, we choose a particular profile for the dynamical interface. We show that a part of the total energy of each side will be lost in the interface. In other words, a time-dependent interface can accumulate or absorb energy. While, in general, the interface follows a time-like trajectory, one can take a particular limit of a profile parameter($β$), such that the interface approaches a null line asymptotically$(β\rightarrow 0)$. In this limit, we show that for a class of boundary conditions, the interface behaves like a `semipermeable membrane'. We also consider another set of conformal boundary conditions for which, in the null line limit, the interface mimics the properties expected of a horizon. In this case, we devise a scattering experiment, where (zero-point subtracted) energy from one CFT is fully transmitted to the other CFT, while from the other CFT, energy can neither be transmitted nor reflected, i.e., it gets lost in the interface. This boundary condition is also responsible for the thermal energy spectrum which mimics Hawking radiation. This is analogous to the black hole where the horizon plays the role of a one-sided `membrane', which accumulates all the interior degrees of freedom and radiates thermally in the presence of quantum fluctuation. Stimulated by this observation, we comment on some plausible construction of wormhole analogues.",{'hawking radiation': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
The Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in Hairy Kerr Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11379v1,"Lai Zhao, Zhaoyi Xu, Meirong Tang","The Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, since its proposal, has always been a controversial hypothesis, but its significance in astrophysics is undeniable. For a regular black hole, its center does not contain a singularity, and the destruction of the horizon of such black holes is not protected by the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. Therefore, we employ Gedanken experiments to study the hairy Kerr black holes, which are promising candidates to serve as ""simulators"" of astrophysical black holes. By investigating these black holes through testing particles and scalar fields carrying large angular momentum, we explore whether these black holes can achieve overspinning. Our results suggest that the overspinning behavior of these hairy Kerr black holes in extreme or near-extreme conditions strongly depends on the hairy parameters (${α, l_0}$). This not only potentially offers us an opportunity to explore the interior structure of black holes, but may also provide clues for constraining the hairy parameters. This phenomenon might reveal the connection between the no-hair theorem of black holes and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, bringing new perspectives to our understanding of these theories.",{'black holes': 8},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our {\it fiducial} model, reionization reaches its mid-point at $z \sim 6.9$ and ends by $z \sim 5.9$. Low stellar mass ($M_*\leq 10^9M_\odot$) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about $77\%$ of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at $z \sim 5$, AGN only provide about $23\%$ of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with $M_* \geq 10^9M_\odot$). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at $z \leq 7$ - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as $z \sim 6.2$, when reionization is already in its end stages.

We checked whether, in the vicinity of the initial cosmic singularity, the ratio of the energy density of free gravity to that of matter density goes to zero or not.

In this framework, we study in full generality energy conditions near the matching surface. As a result, we found that, after imposing the vanishing of the energy density $E$ at the matching surface, if weak and dominant energy conditions (WEC,DEC) are satisfied, then unavoidable strong energy conditions is violated, i.e. near the event horizon only matter with dark energy-like features is allowed.

In order for this matter to fill the inside of a black hole so that its property can be teased out from the Einstein and conservation equations, it must possess a negative pressure ($ξ>0$) to counter the gravitation attraction which draws all matter to the center. In that case a solution of the Einstein and conservation equations exists if and only if the constant $ξ$ is confined within a narrow range, between 0.1429 and 0.1716. In the present paper, we try to find out its dynamical response by injecting additional matter into the black hole over a period of time. The resulting solutions of the six time-dependent Einstein equations and conservation laws are presented in perturbation theory, valid if the total amount of injection is small. Even in perturbation, the solutions can be obtained only with a special trick. The result shows that the equation of state $p(r,t)=-ξ\r(r,t)$ remains unchanged with the same $ξ$ when the injection rate is constant. When the rate changes with time, $ξ$ requires a correction, $ξ\toξ+ξ_1(r,t)$, where $ξ_1(r,t)$ appears to be correlated with the acceleration of the injected matter in a way to be shown in the text.",{'einstein equations': 2},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Thermodynamics of the Weyl Geometric Gravity Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10410v1,"Muhammad F. A. R. Sakti, Piyabut Burikham, Tiberiu Harko","We consider the thermodynamic properties of an exact black hole solution obtained in Weyl geometric gravity theory, by considering the simplest conformally invariant action, constructed from the square of the Weyl scalar, and the strength of the Weyl vector only. The action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and thus it can be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. In static spherical symmetry, this theory admits an exact black hole solution, which generalizes the standard Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution through the presence of two new terms in the metric, having a linear and a quadratic dependence on the radial coordinate, respectively. The solution is obtained by assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component. After studying the locations of the event and cosmological horizons of the Weyl geometric black hole, we investigate in detail the thermodynamical (quantum properties) of this type of black holes, by considering the Hawking temperature, the volume, the entropy, specific heat and the Helmholtz and Gibbs energy functions on both the event and the cosmological horizons. The Weyl geometric black holes have thermodynamic properties that clearly differentiate them from similar solutions of other modified gravity theories. The obtained results may lead to the possibility of a better understanding of the properties of the black holes in alternative gravity, and of the relevance of the thermodynamic aspects in black hole physics.",{'black holes': 3},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Line defects in conformal field theory: from weak to strong coupling,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10336v1,Julien Barrat,"Conformal field theory finds applications across diverse fields, from statistical systems at criticality to quantum gravity through the AdS/CFT correspondence. These theories are subject to strong constraints, enabling a systematic non-perturbative analysis. Conformal defects provide a controlled means of breaking the symmetry, introducing new physical phenomena while preserving crucial benefits of the underlying conformal symmetry. This thesis investigates conformal line defects in both the weak- and strong-coupling regimes. Two distinct classes of models are studied. First, we focus on the supersymmetric Wilson line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills, which serves as an ideal testing ground for the development of innovative techniques such as the analytic conformal bootstrap. The second class consists of magnetic lines in Yukawa models, which have fascinating applications in $3d$ condensed-matter systems.

The algorithm avoids sample repetition and, thus, is efficient at sampling distribution with exponentially decaying tails. We illustrate the computational advantage provided by our optimal sampling method through various numerical examples, involving condensed matter, optimization problems, and quantum circuit scenarios. Theory predicts up to an exponential speedup reducing the scaling for sampling the space up to an accumulated unknown probability $ε$ from $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(ε^{-1}))$ for a decaying probability distribution. We confirm this in practice with over one order of magnitude speedup or multiple orders improvement in the error depending on the application.

Quantum State Obfuscation from Classical Oracles,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10200v1,"James Bartusek, Zvika Brakerski, Vinod Vaikuntanathan","A major unresolved question in quantum cryptography is whether it is possible to obfuscate arbitrary quantum computation. Indeed, there is much yet to understand about the feasibility of quantum obfuscation even in the classical oracle model, where one is given for free the ability to obfuscate any classical circuit.
  In this work, we develop a new array of techniques that we use to construct a quantum state obfuscator, a powerful notion formalized recently by Coladangelo and Gunn (arXiv:2311.07794) in their pursuit of better software copy-protection schemes. Quantum state obfuscation refers to the task of compiling a quantum program, consisting of a quantum circuit $C$ with a classical description and an auxiliary quantum state $\ketψ$, into a functionally-equivalent obfuscated quantum program that hides as much as possible about $C$ and $\ketψ$. We prove the security of our obfuscator when applied to any pseudo-deterministic quantum program, i.e. one that computes a (nearly) deterministic classical input / classical output functionality. Our security proof is with respect to an efficient classical oracle, which may be heuristically instantiated using quantum-secure indistinguishability obfuscation for classical circuits.
  Our result improves upon the recent work of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023) who also showed how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits in the classical oracle model, but only ones with a completely classical description. Furthermore, our result answers a question of Coladangelo and Gunn, who provide a construction of quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation with respect to a quantum oracle. Indeed, our quantum state obfuscator together with Coladangelo-Gunn gives the first candidate realization of a ``best-possible'' copy-protection scheme for all polynomial-time functionalities.",{'quantum circuit': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Methodologically, we use the hyperboloidal framework to cast the QNM problem into an eigenvalue problem associated with a non-selfadjoint operator, and exploit the invariant subspace method to improve the computational efficiency for pseudospectrum. The investigation of the spectrum (in)stability have two aspects. On the one hand, we calculate the spectra of the quantum corrected black hole, then the impact of the quantum correction effect on the Schwarzschild black hole has been studied through migration ratios. The results indicate that the so-called ``migration ratio instability"" will occur for small black holes with small angular momentum number l. In the eikonal limit, the migration ratios remain the same for each overtone. On the other hand, we study the spectrum (in)stability of the quantum corrected black hole by directly adding some particular perturbations into the effective potential, where perturbations are located at the event horizon and null infinity, respectively. There are two interesting observations under the same perturbation energy norm. First, perturbations at infinity are more capable of generating spectrum instability than those at the event horizon.

Moreover, we also calculate the one-loop partition function of graviton in $T\bar{T}$-deformed BTZ black hole.

Phase structure of holographic superconductors in an Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory with spontaneous scalarization,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09846v1,"Hong Guo, Wei-Liang Qian, Bin Wang","Holographic superconductor phase transition and spontaneous scalarization are triggered by the instability of the underlying vacuum black hole spacetime. Although both hairy black hole solutions are closely associated with the tachyonic instability of the scalar degree of freedom, they are understood to be driven by distinct causes. It is, therefore, interesting to explore the interplay between the two phenomena in the context of a scenario where both mechanisms are present. To this end, we investigate the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with a Maxwell field. On the one hand, the presence of the charged scalar and Maxwell fields in anti-de Sitter spacetime furnishes the celebrated framework for a holographic superconductor. On the other hand, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet coupling between the scalar field and the gravitational sector triggers spontaneous scalarization. However, near the transition curve, the two phases are found to be largely indistinguishable regarding both the radial profile and effective potential. This raises the question of whether the hairy black holes triggered by different mechanisms are smoothly joined by a phase transition or whether these are actually identical solutions. To assess the transition more closely, we evaluate the phase diagram in terms of temperature and chemical potential and discover a smooth but first-order transition between the two hairy solutions by explicitly evaluating Gibbs free energy and its derivatives. In particular, one can elaborate a thermodynamic process through which a superconducting black hole transits into a scalarized one by raising or decreasing the temperature. Exhausting the underlying phase space, we analyze the properties and the interplay between the two hairy solutions.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Shankar","Supermassive black holes require a reservoir of cold gas at the centre of their host galaxy in order to accrete and shine as active galactic nuclei (AGN). Major mergers have the ability to drive gas rapidly inwards, but observations trying to link mergers with AGN have found mixed results due to the difficulty of consistently identifying galaxy mergers in surveys. This study applies deep learning to this problem, using convolutional neural networks trained to identify simulated post-merger galaxies from survey-realistic imaging. This provides a fast and repeatable alternative to human visual inspection. Using this tool, we examine a sample of ~8500 Seyfert 2 galaxies (L[OIII] ~ $10^{38.5 - 42}$ erg/s) at z < 0.3 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and find a merger fraction of $2.19_{-0.17}^{+0.21}$% compared with inactive control galaxies, in which we find a merger fraction of $2.96_{-0.20}^{+0.26}$%, indicating an overall lack of mergers among AGN hosts compared with controls. However, matching the controls to the AGN hosts in stellar mass and star formation rate reveals that AGN hosts in the star-forming blue cloud exhibit a ~$2\times$ merger enhancement over controls, while those in the quiescent red sequence have significantly lower relative merger fractions, leading to the observed overall deficit due to the differing $M_{\ast} - $SFR distributions. We conclude that while mergers are not the dominant trigger of all low-luminosity, obscured AGN activity in the nearby Universe, they are more important to AGN fuelling in galaxies with higher cold gas mass fractions as traced through star formation.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Parameterizing black hole orbits for adiabatic inspiral,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09577v1,Scott A. Hughes,"Adiabatic binary inspiral in the small mass ratio limit treats the small body as moving along a geodesic of a large Kerr black hole, with the geodesic slowly evolving due to radiative backreaction. Up to initial conditions, geodesics are typically parameterized in two ways: using the integrals of motion energy $E$, axial angular momentum $L_z$, and Carter constant $Q$; or, using orbit geometry parameters semi-latus rectum $p$, eccentricity $e$, and (cosine of ) inclination $x_I \equiv \cos I$. The community has long known how to compute orbit integrals as functions of the orbit geometry parameters, i.e., as functions expressing $E(p, e, x_I)$, and likewise for $L_z$ and $Q$. Mappings in the other direction -- functions $p(E, L_z, Q)$, and likewise for $e$ and $x_I$ -- have not yet been developed in general. In this note, we develop generic mappings from ($E$, $L_z$, $Q$) to ($p$, $e$, $x_I$). The mappings are particularly simple for equatorial orbits ($Q = 0$, $x_I = \pm1$), and can be evaluated efficiently for generic cases. These results make it possible to more accurately compute adiabatic inspirals by eliminating the need to use a Jacobian which becomes singular as inspiral approaches the last stable orbit.",{'geodesics': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

This generalizes a foundational result in quantum information theory that was previously formulated only for operations and states on finite-dimensional systems. The extension to infinite dimensions is nontrivial because the conventional tools for establishing both the direct and converse bounds, i.e., strong typically, monotonicity, and asymptotic continuity, are no longer directly applicable. To address this problem, we construct a new entanglement dilution protocol for infinite-dimensional states implementable by local operations and a finite amount of one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC), using weak and strong typicality multiple times. We also prove the optimality of this protocol among all protocols even under infinite-dimensional separable operations by developing an argument based on alternative forms of monotonicity and asymptotic continuity of the entanglement of formation for infinite-dimensional states. Along the way, we derive a new integral representation for the quantum entropy of infinite-dimensional states, which we believe to be of independent interest.

Symmetry operators arise from topological field theories localized on a subspace of the boundary CFT spacetime. We use bottom up considerations to construct the topological sector associated with their bulk counterparts. In particular, by exploiting the structure of entanglement wedge reconstruction we argue that the bulk counterpart has a non-topological worldvolume action, i.e., it describes a dynamical object. As a consequence, we find that there are no global $p$-form symmetries for $p \geq 0$ in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, which includes the case of non-invertible symmetries. Provided one has a suitable notion of subregion-subregion duality, our argument for the absence of bulk global symmetries applies to more general spacetimes.

Bhupal Dev, Anish Ghoshal","We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\simeq (10~{\rm GeV}-1~{\rm TeV})$.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

We study the interface dynamics of strongly coupled immiscible binary superfluids by using holographic duality. The full nonlinear evolution of the binary superfluids with a relative velocity shows rich nonlinear patterns toward quantum turbulence, which is reminiscent of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The wave number of the fast growing modes $k_0$ extracted from the interface pattern yields a non-monotonic dependence of the relative velocity, independent of the temperature and interaction. The value of $k_0$ first increases with the velocity difference and then decreases, which stands in sharp contrast to the results of mean-field theory described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and is confirmed by using the linear analyses on top of the stationary configuration. We uncover that the critical velocity associated with the maximum correspond to the case when the mean separation of vortices generated by interface instabilities becomes comparable to the vortex size, which could be a universal physical mechanism at strongly interacting superfluids and is directly testable in laboratory experiments.",{'holographic duality': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']
Probing black holes in a dark matter spike of M87 using quasinormal mode,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09182v1,"Dong Liu, Yi Yang, Zheng-Wen Long","Dark matter density can be significantly enhanced by the supermassive black hole at the galactic center, leading to a structure called dark matter spike. Dark matter spike may change the spacetime properties of black holes that constitute deviations from GR black holes. Based on these interesting background, we construct a set of solutions of black holes in a dark matter spike under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity. Combining the mass model of M87, we study the quasinormal modes of black holes in the scalar field perturbation and compared the with Schwarzschild black hole. Besides, the impacts of dark matter on the quasinormal mode of black holes have been studied in depth. In particular, our results show that the impacts of dark matter spike on the quasinormal mode of black holes can reach up to $10^{-4}$. These new features from quasinormal mode of black holes under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity may provide some help for the establishment of the final dark matter model, and provide a new thought for the indirect detection of dark matter.",{'black holes': 7},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Dynamic Cooling on Contemporary Quantum Computers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09134v1,"Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Antonella De Pasquale, Michele Campisi","We study the problem of dynamic cooling whereby a target qubit is cooled at the expense of heating up $N-1$ further identical qubits, by means of a global unitary operation. A standard back-of-the-envelope high temperature estimate establishes that the target qubit temperature can only be dynamically cooled by at most a factor of $1/\sqrt{N}$. Here, we provide the exact expression for the smallest temperature to which the target qubit can be cooled and reveal that there is a crossover from the high initial temperature regime where the scaling is in fact $1/\sqrt{N}$ to a low initial temperature regime where a much faster scaling of $1/N$ occurs. This slow $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling, relevant for early high-temperature NMR quantum computers, is the reason dynamic cooling was dismissed as ineffectual around 20 years ago; the fact that current low-temperature quantum computers fall in the fast $1/N$ scaling regime, reinstates the appeal of dynamic cooling today. We further show that the associated work cost of cooling is exponentially more advantageous in the low temperature regime. Finally, we discuss the quantum circuit complexity and optimal implementation of dynamic cooling, and examine the effects of noise on cooling in near-term quantum computers.",{'quantum circuit': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Anchordoqui, Ignatios Antoniadis, Dieter Lust","In a recent publication we studied the decay rate of primordial black holes perceiving the dark dimension, an innovative five-dimensional (5D) scenario that has a compact space with characteristic length-scale in the micron range. We demonstrated that the rate of Hawking radiation of 5D black holes slows down compared to 4D black holes of the same mass. Armed with our findings we showed that for a species scale of ${\cal O} (10^{9}~{\rm GeV})$, an all-dark-matter interpretation in terms of primordial black holes should be feasible for black hole masses in the range $10^{14} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$. As a natural outgrowth of our recent study, herein we calculate the Hawking evaporation of near-extremal 5D black holes. Using generic entropy arguments we demonstrate that Hawking evaporation of higher-dimensional near-extremal black holes proceeds at a slower rate than the corresponding Schwarzschild black holes of the same mass. Assisted by this result we show that if there were 5D primordial near-extremal black holes in nature, then a PBH all-dark-matter interpretation would be possible in the mass range $10^{7}\sqrtβ \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$, where $β$ is a parameter that controls the difference between mass and charge of the associated near-extremal black hole.","{'black holes': 8, 'hawking radiation': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Hairy Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes with Asymmetric Vacua,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09039v1,"Xiao Yan Chew, Dong-han Yeom","We minimally coupled a scalar potential $V(φ)$ with asymmetric vacua to the Einstein gravity to numerically construct the hairy Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (RNBH) as a direct generalization of RNBHs to possess scalar hair. By fixing the electric charge to mass ratio $q$, a branch of hairy RNBHs bifurcates from the RNBH when the scalar field $φ_H$ is non-trivial at the horizon. The values of $q$ are bounded for $0 \leq q \leq 1$, which contrast to a class of hairy black holes with $q>1$ in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory. We find that the profiles of solutions affected by the competition between the strength of $φ_H$ and $q$, for instance, the gradient of scalar field at the horizon can increase very sharply when $q \rightarrow 1$ and $φ_H$ is small but its gradient can be very small which independent of $q$ when $φ_H$ is large. Furthermore, the weak energy condition of hairy RNBHs, particularly at the horizon can be satisfied when $q>0$.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Detecting Dark Matter Substructures on Small Scales with Fast Radio Bursts,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08862v1,"Huangyu Xiao, Liang Dai, Matthew McQuinn","We propose measuring the arrival time difference of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) along two adjacent sightlines as a new probe to dark matter substructures on scales down to $\sim 1\,$AU. We discuss two observational scenarios in which it may be possible to place interesting constraints on such models through monitoring repeating FRB sources: 1) By sending radio receivers to space to form a baseline of tens of AU or more and measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between receivers. 2) By measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between two lensed images of one strongly lensed repeater. In both scenarios, obtaining interesting constraints requires correlating the voltage time series to measure the radio-signal arrival time to sub-nanosecond precision. We find that two radio dishes separated by $20\,$AU may be sensitive to the enhancement of small-scale structures at $\sim 10^{-8}M_\odot$ masses in the QCD axion dark matter scenario or from an early epoch of matter-domination with a reheating temperature up to 60 MeV. Other dark matter models such as those composed of $\sim 10^{-13}M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes produced during inflation would also be probed by this method. We further show that a strong lensing situation of multiple images provides an equivalent $\sim 2000\,$AU baseline, which can be much more sensitive but with the uncertainty that intervening ISM decoherence may degrade the timing precision and that spatial variation in the FRB emission spot may result in confounding signals. We show that the lensing magnifications of Type Ia supernovea constrain a similar quantity to such FRB timing, with present limits being equivalent to ruling out the same parameter space that would be probed by a $0.14~$AU baseline.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Starting from the corrections originally computed by Drummond and Hathrell, we solve the full semiclassical Einstein-Maxwell system of coupled equations to leading order in Planck constant, and find a new electrically charged, static black hole solution. To probe these quantum corrections, we study electromagnetic and gravitational (axial) perturbations on this background, and derive the coupled system of Regge-Wheeler master equations that govern the propagation of these waves. In the classical limit our results agree with previous findings in the literature. We finally compare these results with those that one can obtain by working out the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. We find again a new electrically charged static black hole spacetime, and derive the coupled system of Regge-Wheeler equations governing the propagation of axial electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations.

Using the classical definition of radio-loudness, $R=\log(L_{\rm{1.4GHz}}/L_{i})$, we identify 3,697 radio-loud (RL) and 111,132 radio-quiet (RQ) sources at $0.6<z<3.4$. To study their properties, we develop a new rest-frame spectral stacking algorithm, designed with forthcoming massively-multiplexed spectroscopic surveys in mind, and use it to create high signal-to-noise composite spectra of each class, matched in redshift and absolute $i$-band magnitude. We show that RL quasars have redder continuum and enhanced [OII] emission than their RQ counterparts. These results persist when additionally matching in black hole mass, suggesting that this parameter is not the defining factor in making a QSO radio-loud. We find that these features are not gradually varying as a function of radio-loudness but are maintained even when probing deeper into the RQ population, indicating that a clear-cut division in radio-loudness is not apparent. Upon examining the star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from the [OII] emission line, with the contribution from AGN removed using the [NeV] line, we find that RL quasars have a significant excess of star-formation relative to RQ quasars out to $z=1.9$ at least.

In this paper, we carry out the related study about shadow of Kerr black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings in Rastall gravity, which deviates from the Kerr black hole due to the presence of the string parameter $a_0$ and the parameter $β$. The horizons, ergospheres, and photon region of the black hole are shown. Moreover, we explore the shadow and observations of the black hole, which are closely linked to the parameters $a_0$ and $β$. Treating M87* as Kerr black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings under Rastall gravity, we constrain the black hole parameters by the EHT observations. For a given $β$, the circularity deviation of the black hole obeys $ΔC\lesssim0.1$ in all regions. The angular diameter $θ_{d}=42\pm3μas$ can give the upper bound of parameters $a$ and $a_0$ for fixed $β$. The shadow axis ratio satisfies the observation data of EHT ($1<D_x\lesssim4/3$) in the whole space for a given $β$. These results are consistent with the public information of EHT.

We show that its late-time growth rate aligns with the critical momenta linked to the extremal hypersurface. Consequently, we select the Gauss-Bonnet invariant as the scalar function in the definition of generalized volume complexity to examine the complexity's temporal variation. Interestingly, we note the possibility of numerous pseudo phase behaviors intricately tied to the configurations of the effective potentials related to the codimension-one hypersurface. Nevertheless, the complexity shows a linear growth in the ultimate phase in every scenario.

These stochastic source terms are defined in terms of the only dynamical scalar degree of freedom in single-field inflation and all depend simply on the first two time derivatives of the coarse-graining window function, on the gauge-invariant mode functions that satisfy the Mukhanov-Sasaki evolution equation, and on the slow-roll parameters. We validate the efficacy of these Langevin dynamics directly using an example in uniform field gauge, obtaining the stochastic e-fold number without the need for a first-passage-time analysis.

Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.",{'black holes': 3},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Assuming a background B-field (or any field that behaves like one), we examine the Gertsenshtein mechanism in the context of FLRW expanding universe models, as well as de Sitter space. The conformal invariance of Maxwell's equations and the conformal noninvariance of the Einstein equations preclude the operation of the Gertsenshtein effect at all scales. In general we find for the matter- and radiation-dominated cases, graviton-oscillations are possible only at late conformal times or when the wavelengths are much shorter than the horizon ($\kη\gg 1$), but that the time-dependent oscillations eventually damp out in any case. For the de Sitter universe, we find that oscillations are possible only at early conformal times ($η\ll H^{-1}$) and for wavelengths short compared to the Hubble radius, but eventually freeze in when wavelengths become longer than the Hubble radius. In principle a Gertsenshtein-like mechanism might influence the balance of particle species in an inflationary phase before freezing in; however, we find that in all our models the mixing length is larger than the Hubble radius.

The phenylene ethynylene (PE) dendrimers display great potential in improving the efficiency of solar cells, because of their excellent photo-harvesting and exciton-transport properties. In this work, we investigated the intramolecular EET dynamics in a dendrimer composed of two linear PE units (2-ring and 3-ring) using the full quantum dynamics based on the tensor network method. We first constructed a diabatic model Hamiltonian based on the electronic structure calculations. Using this diabatic vibronic coupling model, we tried to obtain the main features of the EET dynamics in terms of the several diabatic models with different numbers of vibrational modes (from 4 modes to 129 modes) and to explore the corresponding vibronic coupling interactions. The results show that the EET in the current PE dendrimer is an ultrafast process. Four modes with A' symmetry play dominant roles in the dynamics, other 86 modes with A' symmetry can damp the electronic coherence, and the modes of A"" symmetry do not show the significant influence on the EET process. Overall, the first-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms show the dominant roles in the EET dynamics, while the second-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms give the visible impact here by damping the electronic coherence and slowing down the overall EET process.

Quantum Simulations of Hadron Dynamics in the Schwinger Model using 112 Qubits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08044v1,"Roland C. Farrell, Marc Illa, Anthony N. Ciavarella, Martin J. Savage","Hadron wavepackets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using 112 qubits of IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino. The initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions.

Calibration of an SKA-Low Prototype Station Using Holographic Techniques,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08039v1,"Jishnu N. Thekkeppattu, Randall B. Wayth, Marcin Sokolowski","Performance of digitally beamformed phased arrays relies on accurate calibration of the array by obtaining gains of each antenna in the array. The stations of the Square Kilometer Array-Low (SKA-Low) are such digital arrays, where the station calibration is currently performed using conventional interferometric techniques. An alternative calibration technique similar to holography of dish based telescopes has been suggested in the past. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical framework for holography employing tensors, which are multi-way data structures. Self-holography using a reference beam formed with the station under test itself and cross-holography using a different station to obtain the reference beam are unified under the same formalism. Besides, the relation between the two apparently distinct holographic approaches in the literature for phased arrays is shown, and we show that under certain conditions the two methods yield the same results. We test the various holographic techniques on an SKA-Low prototype station Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2) with the Sun as the calibrator. We perform self-holography of AAVS2 and cross-holography with simultaneous observations carried out with another station Engineering Development Array 2.

Differentiation of Linear Optical Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07997v2,"Giovanni de Felice, Christopher Cortlett","Experimental setups based on linear optical circuits and single photon sources offer a promising platform for near-term quantum machine learning. However, current applications are all based on support vector machines and gradient-free optimization methods. Differentiating an optical circuit over a phase parameter poses difficulty because it results in an operator on the Fock space which is not unitary. In this paper, we show that the derivative of the expectation values of a linear optical circuit can be computed by sampling from a larger circuit, using one additional photon. In order to express the derivative in terms of expectation values, we develop a circuit extraction procedure based on unitary dilation. We end by showing that the full gradient of a universal programmable interferometer can be estimated using polynomially many queries to a boson sampling device. This is in contrast to the qubit setting, where exponentially many parameters are needed to cover the space of unitaries.

However, the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} has now discovered less luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $z >$ 4 and a few massive black holes (BHs) at $z >$ 10, which may be the progenitors of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) but at different stages of growth. Radio detections of these new AGNs would provide complementary measures of their properties and those of their host galaxies. Here we estimate radio flux densities for 19 new AGNs found by the JADES, CEERS and UNCOVER surveys. We find that ngVLA should be able to detect most of these sources in targeted surveys with integration times of 10 - 100 hr (and in just 1 hr for a few of them) but most would require at least 100 hr of SKA time in spite of its greater sensitivities at low frequencies. In some cases, radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that of H II regions and supernovae in their host galaxies, which could be used to estimate their star formation rates.

We first study existence of gradient CKVs via the obtention of a relationship between the Ricci curvature and the gradient of the divergence of the CKV. This provides an alternative set of equations, for which the integrability condition is obtained, to analyze the existence of gradient CKVs. A uniqueness result is obtained in the case of perfect fluids, where it is demonstrated that the Robertson-Walker solution is the unique perfect fluid solution with a nonvanishing pressure, admitting a timelike gradient CKV. The constant mean curvature condition for LRS spacetimes is also obtained, characterized by three distinct conditions which are specified by a set of three scalars. Linear combinations of these scalars, whose vanishing define the constant mean curvature condition, turn out to be related to the evolutions of null expansions of 2-sphere along their null normal directions. As such, some implications for the existence of black holes and the character of the associated horizons are obtained.

This paper explores the integration of quantum machine learning and variational quantum circuits to augment the efficacy of diffusion-based image generation models. Specifically, we address two challenges of classical diffusion models: their low sampling speed and the extensive parameter requirements. We introduce two quantum diffusion models and benchmark their capabilities against their classical counterparts using MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

Solution of JWST and HST problems by primordial black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06882v1,A. D.

We also demonstrate how NWQ-Sim can be used to examine the effects of errors that occur on real quantum devices, using a combined device noise model. Moreover, NWQ-Sim is particularly well-suited for implementing variational quantum algorithms where circuits are dynamically generated. Therefore, we also illustrate this with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for the Ising model. In both cases, NWQ-Sim's performance is comparable to or better than alternative simulators.

In this work, we extend this interpretation to the case of charged species. We provide working definitions of minimal black holes for the case of uncharged and charged species constituents. Then, examining the modifications in the thermodynamic properties of near-extremal charged species compared to the uncharged case, we uncover interesting implications for the cosmology of an expanding universe, particularly within the context of the Dark Dimensions Scenario.

Compact objects in and beyond the Standard Model from non-perturbative vacuum scalarization,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06716v1,"Loris Del Grosso, Paolo Pani, Alfredo Urbano","We consider a theory in which a real scalar field is Yukawa-coupled to a fermion and has a potential with two non-degenerate vacua. If the coupling is sufficiently strong, a collection of N fermions deforms the true vacuum state, creating energetically-favored false-vacuum pockets in which fermions are trapped. We embed this model within General Relativity and prove that it admits self-gravitating compact objects where the scalar field acquires a non-trivial profile due to non-perturbative effects. We discuss some applications of this general mechanism: i) neutron soliton stars in low-energy effective QCD, which naturally happen to have masses around 2 solar masses and radii around 10 km even without neutron interactions; ii) Higgs false-vacuum pockets in and beyond the Standard Model; iii) dark soliton stars in models with a dark sector. In the latter two examples, we find compelling solutions naturally describing centimeter-size compact objects with masses around 10^-6 solar masses, intriguingly in a range compatible with the OGLE+HSC microlensing anomaly. Besides these interesting examples, the mechanism of non-perturbative vacuum scalarization may play a role in various contexts in and beyond the Standard Model, providing a support mechanism for new compact objects that can form in the early universe, can collapse into primordial black holes through accretion past their maximum mass, and serve as dark matter candidates.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
On the existence of charged electrostatic black holes in arbitrary topology,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06702v1,Martin Reiris,"The general classification of 3+1-static black hole solutions of the Einstein equations, with or without matter, is central in General Relativity and important in geometry. In the realm of S1-symmetric vacuum spacetimes, a recent classification proved that, without restrictions on the topology or the asymptotic behavior, black hole solutions can be only of three kinds: (i) Schwarzschild black holes, (ii) Boost black holes, or (iii) Myers-Korotkin-Nicolai black holes, each one having its distinct asymptotic and topological type. In contrast to this, very little is known about the general classification of S1-symmetric static electrovacuum black holes although examples show that, on the large picture, there should be striking differences with respect to the vacuum case. A basic question then is whether or not there are charged analogs to the static vacuum black holes of types (i), (ii) and (iii). In this article we prove the remarkable fact that, while one can `charge' the Schwarzschild solution (resulting in a Reissner-Nordström spacetime) preserving the asymptotic, one cannot do the same to the Boosts and to the Myers-Korotkin-Nicolai solutions: the addition of a small or large electric charge, if possible at all, would transform entirely their asymptotic behavior. In particular, such vacuum solutions cannot be electromagnetically perturbed. The results of this paper are consistent but go far beyond the works of Karlovini and Von Unge on periodic analogs of the Reissner-Nordström black holes.
  The type of result as well as the techniques used are based on comparison geometry a la Bakry-Émery and appear to be entirely novel in this context. The findings point to a complex interplay between asymptotic, topology and charge in spacetime dimension 3+1, markedly different from what occurs in higher dimensions.","{'black holes': 6, 'einstein equations': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude, still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard problem.
  This article aims at investigating the limits of current state-of-the-art simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum subroutines, each in 31 different configurations, with special emphasis on performance. We then correlate the performance measures of the simulators with the metrics that characterise the benchmark circuits, identifying the main reasons behind the observed performance trend.

Windom, Daniel Claudino, Rodney J.

Augmenting computationally affordable low-rank approximations in CC theory with a perturbative account of higher-rank excitations is a tractable and effective way of accounting for the missing electron correlation in those approximations. This is perhaps best exemplified by the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) method, which bolsters the baseline CCSD with effects of triple excitations using considerations from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Despite this established success, such a synergy between MBPT and the unitary analog of CC theory (UCC) has not been explored. In this work, we propose a similar approach wherein converged UCCSD amplitudes, which can be obtained on a quantum computer, are leveraged by a classical computer to evaluate energy corrections associated with triple excitations - leading to the UCCSD[T] and UCCSD(T*) methods. The rationale behind these choices is shown to be rigorous by studying the properties of finite-order UCC energy functionals. Although our efforts do not support the addition of the fifth-order contribution as in the (T) correction, comparisons are nevertheless made using a hybrid UCCSD(T) approach.

"Jets, Outflows, and Explosions in Massive Star Formation",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05623v1,John Bally,"Multispectral studies of nearby, forming stars provide insights into all classes of accreting systems. Objects which have magnetic fields, spin, and accrete produce jets and collimated outflows. Jets are seen in systems ranging from brown dwarf stars to supermassive black holes. Outflow speeds are typically a few times the escape speed from the launch region - 100s of \kms\ for young stars to nearly the speed of light for black-holes. Because many young stellar objects (YSOs) are nearby, we can see outflow evolution and measure proper motions on times scales of years. Because the shocks in YSO outflows emit in atoms, ions, and molecules in addition to the continuum, many physical properties such as temperatures, densities, and velocities can be measured. Momenta and kinetic energies can be computed. YSO outflows are a major source of feedback in the self-regulation of star formation. The lessons learned can be applied to much more distant and energetic cosmic sources such as AGN and galactic nuclear super winds - systems in which evolution occurs on time-scales of hundreds to millions of years. Some dense star-forming regions produce powerful explosions. The nearest massive star-forming region, Orion OMC1, powered a $\sim 10^{48}$ erg explosion about 550 years ago (that is when the light from the event would have reached the Solar System). The OMC1 explosion was likely powered by an N-body interaction which resulted in the formation of a compact, AU-scale binary or resulted in a protostellar merger. The binary or merger remnant, the $\sim$15 \Msol\ object known as radio source I (Src I) was ejected from the core with a speed of $\sim$10 \kms\ along with two other stars.

Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of RELXILL (modified to read the table of REFLIONX, which is the non-relativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that RELXILL with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk's ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated.

Achieving quantum advantages usually requires a large number of qubits and quantum circuits with enough capacity. However, limited coherence time and massive quantum noises severely constrain the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably on real machines. To address these two pain points, we propose QuantumSEA, an in-time sparse exploration for noise-adaptive quantum circuits, aiming to achieve two key objectives: (1) implicit circuits capacity during training - by dynamically exploring the circuit's sparse connectivity and sticking a fixed small number of quantum gates throughout the training which satisfies the coherence time and enjoy light noises, enabling feasible executions on real quantum devices; (2) noise robustness - by jointly optimizing the topology and parameters of quantum circuits under real device noise models. In each update step of sparsity, we leverage the moving average of historical gradients to grow necessary gates and utilize salience-based pruning to eliminate insignificant gates.

In the weak field limit, we calculate the light deflection angle of M87* and Sgr A* via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). With the growth of deviation parameter $e$, the gravitational lensing effect in the weak field limit intensifies monotonically, and the gravitational lensing effect in the strong field limit changes dramatically only at high spins.

The challenge of exploring the cost function of VQAs arising from an exponential proliferation of local minima with increasing circuit depth has been well-documented. However, fewer studies have investigated the impact of circuit depth on QAOA performance in finding the correct Max-Cut solution. Here, we employ basin-hopping global optimisation methods to navigate the energy landscapes for QAOA ansätze for various graphs, and analyse QAOA performance in finding the correct Max-Cut solution. The structure of the solution space is also investigated using discrete path sampling to build databases of local minima and the transition states that connect them, providing insightful visualisations using disconnectivity graphs. We find that the corresponding landscapes generally have a single funnel organisation, which makes it relatively straightforward to locate low-lying minima with good Max-Cut solution probabilities. In some cases below the adiabatic limit the second lowest local minimum may even yield a higher solution probability than the global minimum. This important observation has motivated us to develop broader metrics in evaluating QAOA performance, based on collections of minima obtained from basin-hopping global optimisation. Hence we establish expectation thresholds in elucidating useful solution probabilities from local minima, an approach that may provide significant gains in elucidating reasonable solution probabilities from local minima.",{'quantum circuit': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Influence of plasma on the optical appearance of spinning black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity and its Existence around M87* and Sgr A*,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04779v1,"Muhammad Ali Raza, M. Zubair, Eiman Maqsood","The visible universe is filled with different types of plasma media in the form of stars, nebulas and other forms of excited gases. These matter fields have a high influence on the gravity and are likely to be present around the black holes due to the immense gravitational attraction. Since a plasma medium affects the speed of light, therefore we investigated the null geodesics and various optical features around the rotating black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity immersed in plasma medium. Various plasma distributions are considered to develop a comparative study for their influence on unstable null circular orbits, shadows and evaporation rate of the black hole in the presence of a plasma medium. Moreover, the shadow results are also compared with Event Horizon Telescope data for M78* and Sgr A* in order to estimate the parametric bounds for which the rotating black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity is considered either M87* or Sgr A* under the different values of plasma parameters. From this analysis, we also found the distribution of plasma that has a significant impact on the above mentioned features and is most likely to be present around M87* and Sgr A*.","{'black holes': 1, 'geodesics': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

The models are exactly solvable in the limit of a large number of on-site fermions. The four-site chain exhibits a quantum phase transition controlled by the hopping parameters and manifests itself in a discontinuous entanglement entropy, obtained by constraining the one-sided modular Hamiltonian. Inspired by recent work within the AdS/CFT correspondence, we identify transitions between types of von Neumann operator algebras throughout the phase diagram. We find transitions of the form II$_1\leftrightarrow\,$III$\,\,\leftrightarrow\,\,$I$_\infty$ that reduce to II$_1\leftrightarrow\,\,$I$_\infty$ in the strongly interacting limit, where they connect non-factorized and factorized ground states.

Entanglement inside a black hole before the Page time,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04706v2,"Yuxuan Liu, Shao-Kai Jian, Yi Ling, Zhuo-Yu Xian","We investigate the evolution of entanglement within an open, strongly coupled system interacting with a heat bath as its environment, in the frameworks of both the doubly holographic model and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases as a result of internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole hermalized by holographic matters. The reflected entropy between the bipartition of a large black hole exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time. In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in a global thermofield double state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting with an environment. The Rényi mutual information within the double-copied SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system and the external interaction with the baths. Our study provides a fine-grained picture of the dynamics of entanglement inside black holes before their Page time.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Azimuthal geodesics in closed FLRW cosmologies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04597v1,"Christian G.

Azimuthal geodesics, on the other hand, are perhaps best known for their relevance within closed cosmological models. Such models typically have a finite lifetime: the universe expands up to a maximum size after which it recollapses during the so-called big crunch. An azimuthal geodesic starting at the beginning of the universe will travel a finite angular distance during the expansion and recollapse. It is well-known that this angle is $2π$ for a matter-dominated universe and $π$ for a radiation-dominated solution. Here we derive the simple formula $$Δ\varphi = \frac{2π}{1+3w}$$ for an arbitrary linear equation of state parameter $w$.

The gauge field source to the Einstein equation is a power-Maxwell nonlinear electrodynamics with traceless energy-momentum tensor. The coupled Einstein-power-Maxwell-scalar gravity system, which carries the coupling $f(φ)$ between the gauge and scalar fields, is analyzed, and hairy charged black hole solutions are found analytically. We consider three different profiles of the coupling functions: (i) $f(φ)=1$, corresponding to no direct coupling between the gauge and scalar fields, (ii) $f(φ)=e^φ$, and (iii) $f(φ)=e^{φ^2/2}$, corresponding to their non-minimal coupling. For all these cases, the scalar field, gauge fields, and curvature scalars are regular and well-behaved everywhere outside the horizon. We further study the thermodynamics of the obtained hairy black hole in the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles and find significant changes in its thermodynamic structure due to the scalar field. In particular, for all considered coupling functions, the hairy parameter has a critical value above which the hairy black hole undergoes the Hawking/Page phase transition, whereas below which no such phase transition appears.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

The nonperturbative simulation of the Yukawa model field theory is verified on IBM's simulator and is also demonstrated on a small-scale IBM circuit-based quantum processor, on the cloud, using IBM Qiskit. The light front formulation allows for controlling the resource requirement and complexity of the computation with commensurate trade-offs in accuracy and detail by modulating a single parameter, namely the harmonic resolution. Qubit operators for the bosonic excitations were also created and were used along with the fermionic ones already available, to simulate the theory involving all of these particles. With the restriction on the number of logical qubits available on the existent gate-based Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, the trotterization approximation is also used. We show that experimentally relevant quantities like cross-sections for various processes, survival probabilities of various states, etc. can be computed.

Multi-entropy at low Renyi index in 2d CFTs,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04236v2,"Jonathan Harper, Tadashi Takayanagi, Takashi Tsuda","For a static time slice of AdS$_3$ we describe a particular class of minimal surfaces which form trivalent networks of geodesics. Through geometric arguments we provide evidence that these surfaces describe a measure of multipartite entanglement. By relating these surfaces to Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces it can be shown that this multipartite contribution is related to the angles of intersection of the bulk geodesics.
  A proposed boundary dual, the multi-entropy, generalizes replica trick calculations involving twist operators by considering monodromies with finite group symmetry beyond the cyclic group used for the computation of entanglement entropy. We make progress by providing explicit calculations of Renyi multi-entropy in two dimensional CFTs and geometric descriptions of the replica surfaces for several cases with low genus.
  We also explore aspects of the free fermion and free scalar CFTs. For the free fermion CFT we examine subtleties in the definition of the twist operators used for the calculation of Renyi multi-entropy.

To construct this map, we developed new techniques for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model.

Simulating the formation of black holes within cosmological mini-haloes at $z \sim 20$, we investigate both the core-collapse and direct-collapse channels, which result in BHs of initial mass $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ and $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ respectively. Our explicit focus on the stellar-mass range pushes the maximum resolution down to sub-$10^{-3} \, \text{pc}$ regimes, where more complicated gas dynamics are resolved. We observe efficient growth and rotationally supported, $\sim$$10^{-1} \, \text{pc}$-scale discs around all $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs independent of resolution and accretion scheme, though clumps, bars, and spiral arm structures impact stability at high resolution. We analyse the effect of these instabilities on the accretion cycle. In contrast, all bar one of the $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs fail to attract a disc and experience modest growth, even when characteristic scales of accretion and dynamical friction are reasonably resolved. While the two accretion schemes somewhat converge in mass growth for the $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ case over $1 \, \text{Myr}$, the greater degree of gas fragmentation induces more randomness in the evolution of the $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs. We conclude that early universe black holes of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^1 \, \text{M}_\odot$ struggle to grow even in gas-rich environments without feedback in comparison to seeds of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^2 \, \text{M}_\odot$, and the latter exhibit convergent growth histories across accretion schemes below a spatial resolution of $1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{pc}$.",{'black holes': 3},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Efficient Quantum Trace Estimation with Reconfigurable Real-Time Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04176v1,"Yizhi Shen, Katherine Klymko, Eran Rabani, Daan Camps, Roel Van Beeumen, Michael Lindsey","Recently, quantum algorithms that leverage real-time evolution under a many-body Hamiltonian have proven to be exceptionally effective in estimating individual eigenvalues near the edge of the Hamiltonian spectrum, such as the ground state energy. By contrast, evaluating the trace of an operator requires the aggregation of eigenvalues across the entire spectrum. In this work, we introduce an efficient near-term quantum algorithm for computing the trace of a broad class of operators, including matrix functions of the target Hamiltonian. Our trace estimator is similar to the classical Girard-Hutchinson estimator in that it involves the preparation of many random states. Although the exact Girard-Hutchinson estimator is not tractably realizable on a quantum computer, we can construct random states that match the variance of the Girard-Hutchinson estimator through only real-time evolution. Importantly, our random states are all generated using the same Hamiltonians for real-time evolution, with randomness owing only to stochastic variations in the duration of the evolutions. In this sense, the circuit is reconfigurable and suitable for realization on both digital and analog platforms. For numerical illustration, we highlight important applications in the physical, chemical, and materials sciences, such as calculations of density of states and free energy.",{'quantum computer': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect. We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters.

In this work, we focus on two fundamental tasks from the study of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems: search-to-decision reductions, and approximate counting. We first show that, in strong contrast to the classical setting where a poly-time Turing machine requires $Θ(n)$ queries to an NP oracle to compute a witness to a given SAT formula, quantumly $Θ(\log n)$ queries suffice. We then show this is tight in the black-box model - any quantum algorithm with ""NP-like"" query access to a formula requires $Ω(\log n)$ queries to extract a solution with constant probability. Moving to approximate counting of SAT solutions, by exploiting a quantum link between search-to-decision reductions and approximate counting, we show that existing classical approximate counting algorithms are likely optimal.

The analysis of the individual evolution of the most massive BHs suggests that they are generally passing by three different regimes. First, for a short period after their birth, low mass BHs (<3x10^4 Ms) are rapidly spun up by gas accretion and their spin tends to be aligned with their host galaxy spin. Then follows a second phase in which the accretion of gas onto low mass BHs (<10^5 Ms) is quite chaotic and inefficient, reflecting the complex and disturbed morphologies of forming proto-galaxies at high redshifts. The variations of Psi are rather erratic during this phase and are mainly driven by the rapid changes of the direction of the galaxy angular momentum. Then, in a third and long phase, BHs are generally well settled in the center of galaxies around which the gas accretion becomes much more coherent (>10^5 Ms). In this case, the BH spins tend to be well aligned with the angular momentum of their host galaxy and this configuration is generally stable even though BH merger episodes can temporally induce misalignment. We have also derived the distributions of cos(Psi) at different redshifts and found that BHs and galaxy spins are generally aligned. Finally, based on a Monte Carlo method, we also predict statistics for the 2-d projected spin-orbit angles lambda. In particular, the distribution of lambda traces well the alignment tendency in the 3-d analysis.

However, in this work, we explicitly compute the Bogoliubov coefficients associated with incoming and outgoing modes, which not only yields the temperature but also thermal spectrum of particles emitted by a black hole. For illustration, we take the simplest nontrivial example of the linear Vaidya spacetime, which is conformal to the static metric and using this property, we analytically solve the massless scalar field in its background. This allows the explicit computations of the Bogoliubov coefficients to study the particle production in this spacetime.

We find that low-order PN models are sufficient for simulating low-mass ($\le 50\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$) SBBHs population. Moreover, for detectable SBBHs in space-based GW detectors, over 90% of the GW signals from low-order PN models meet accuracy requirement. Additionally, different PN models do not exhibit significant differences in Bayesian inference.

Of note, we find that the effective temperature of the ${\langle N\rangle}$ distribution remains regular for observers at the event horizon but becomes negative and divergent for observers reaching the inner Cauchy horizon.

Ground state energy and magnetization curve of a frustrated magnetic system from real-time evolution on a digital quantum processor,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03015v1,"Aaron Szasz, Ed Younis, Wibe Albert de Jong","Models of interacting many-body quantum systems that may realize new exotic phases of matter, notably quantum spin liquids, are challenging to study using even state-of-the-art classical methods such as tensor network simulations. Quantum computing provides a promising route for overcoming these difficulties to find ground states, dynamics, and more. In this paper, we argue that recently developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on real-time evolution are promising methods for solving a particularly important model in the search for spin liquids, the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional kagome lattice. We show how to construct efficient quantum circuits to implement time evolution for the model and to evaluate key observables on the quantum computer, and we argue that the method has favorable scaling with increasing system size. We then restrict to a 12-spin star plaquette from the kagome lattice and a related 8-spin system, and we give an empirical demonstration on these small systems that the hybrid algorithms can efficiently find the ground state energy and the magnetization curve. For these demonstrations, we use four levels of approximation: exact state vectors, exact state vectors with statistical noise from sampling, noisy classical emulators, and (for the 8-spin system only) real quantum hardware, specifically the Quantinuum H1-1 processor; for the noisy simulations, we also employ error mitigation strategies based on the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Our results strongly suggest that these hybrid algorithms present a promising direction for resolving important unsolved problems in condensed matter theory and beyond.","{'quantum computer': 1, 'tensor network': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,"['Tensor Networks', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

Recently, quantum kernel alignment techniques that parameterise the kernel have been developed, allowing the kernel to be trained and therefore aligned with a specific dataset. While quantum kernel alignment is a promising technique, it has been hampered by considerable training costs because the full kernel matrix must be constructed at every training iteration. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel method that seeks to balance efficiency and performance. We present a sub-sampling training approach that uses a subset of the kernel matrix at each training step, thereby reducing the overall computational cost of the training. In this work, we apply the sub-sampling method to synthetic datasets and a real-world breast cancer dataset and demonstrate considerable reductions in the number of circuits required to train the quantum kernel while maintaining classification accuracy.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Gertsenshtein-Zel&#39;dovich gravitational analog can enable detection of solar mass black holes in Milky way galaxy,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02790v1,"Susmita Jana, Rituparno Goswami, S. Shankaranarayanan, Sunil D. Maharaj","The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to be home to ten million to a billion stellar-mass black holes (BHs). Accurately determining this number and distribution of BH masses can provide crucial information about the processes involved in BH formation, the possibility of the existence of primordial BHs, and interpreting gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. Sahu et al. recently confirmed one isolated stellar-mass BH in our galaxy using astrometric microlensing. This work proposes a novel method to identify such BHs using the gravitational analog of the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) effect. We explicitly demonstrate the generation of GWs when a kilohertz(kHz) electromagnetic (EM) pulse from a pulsar is intervened by a spherically symmetric compact object situated between the pulsar and Earth. Specifically, we show that the curvature of spacetime acts as the catalyst, akin to the magnetic field in the GZ effect. Using the covariant semi-tetrad formalism, we quantify the GW generated from the EM pulse through the Regge-Wheeler tensor and express the amplitude of the generated GW in terms of the EM energy and flux. We demonstrate how GW detectors can detect stellar-mass BHs by considering known pulsars within our galaxy. This approach has a distinct advantage in detecting stellar mass BHs at larger distances since the GW amplitude falls as $1/r$.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Investigation of hidden symmetry in $AdS_{5}$ black hole with Heun equation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02761v1,"Jafar Sadeghi, Mohammad Ali S.

Expanding this unique method of study to cosmic structures and combining past knowledge with new data can be very interesting and lead to discovering new ways to analyze these systems. However, studying black hole symmetries always presents many complications and sometimes requires computational approximations. For example, checking the existence of Killing vectors and then calculating them is not always an easy task. It becomes much more difficult as the structure and geometry of the system become more complex. In this work, we will show that if the wave equations with a black hole background can be converted in the form of general Heun equation, based on its structure and coefficients, the algebra of the system can be easily studied, and computational and geometrical complications can be omitted. For this purpose, we selected two $AdS_5$ black holes: Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N) and Kerr, and analyzed the Klein-Gordon equation with the background of these black holes. Based on this concept, we observed that the radial part of the R-N black hole and both the radial and angular parts of the Kerr black hole could be transformed into the general form of the Heun equation.

The virial factor had been believed to be independent of accretion radiation pressure on gas clouds in broad-line region (BLR), and only dependent on inclination effects of BLR. The virial factor measured spans a very large range. For the vast majority of AGNs ($>$96%) in our samples, the virial factor is larger than $f=1$ usually used in literatures. The $f$ correction makes the percent of high-accreting AGNs decrease by about 100 times. There are positive correlations of $f$ with the dimensionless accretion rate and Eddington ratio. The redward shifts of H$β$ and H$α$ are mainly the gravitational origin, confirmed by a negative correlation between the redward shift and the dimensionless radius of BLR. Our results show that radiation pressure force is a significant contributor to the measured virial factor, containing the inclination effects of BLR. The usually used values of $f$ should be corrected for high-accreting AGNs, especially high redshift quasars. The $f$ correction increases their masses by one--two orders of magnitude, which will make it more challenging to explain the formation and growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Link-area commutators in AdS${}_3$ area-networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02487v1,"Jesse Held, Molly Kaplan, Donald Marolf, Jie-qiang Wu","Random tensor networks (RTNs) have proved to be fruitful tools for modelling the AdS/CFT correspondence. Due to their flat entanglement spectra, when discussing a given boundary region $R$ and its complement $\bar R$, standard RTNs are most analogous to fixed-area states of the bulk quantum gravity theory, in which quantum fluctuations have been suppressed for the area of the corresponding HRT surface. However, such RTNs have flat entanglement spectra for all choices of $R, \bar R,$ while quantum fluctuations of multiple HRT-areas can be suppressed only when the corresponding HRT-area operators mutually commute. We probe the severity of such obstructions in pure AdS$_3$ Einstein-Hilbert gravity by constructing networks whose links are codimension-2 extremal-surfaces and by explicitly computing semiclassical commutators of the associated link-areas. Since $d=3,$ codimension-2 extremal-surfaces are geodesics, and codimension-2 `areas' are lengths. We find a simple 4-link network defined by an HRT surface and a Chen-Dong-Lewkowycz-Qi constrained HRT surface for which all link-areas commute. However, the algebra generated by the link-areas of more general networks tends to be non-Abelian. One such non-Abelian example is associated with entanglement-wedge cross sections and may be of more general interest.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'geodesics': 1, 'tensor networks': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,"['Tensor Networks', 'Holography', 'Black Holes and GR']"

The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early followup of SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early universe. J0931+0038 has relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.76 +/- 0.13) but an extreme odd-even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass > 50 Msun, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions. Though rare, more examples of unusual early nucleosynthesis in metal-poor stars should be found in upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In particular, this quantity, that we call the \emph{space-time mutual information}, bounds all dynamical correlations. We construct this quantity based on the idea of the quantum hypothesis testing. As a by-product, our definition provides a transparent interpretation in terms of an experimentally accessible setup.

Our analysis is carried with respect to the involved parameters including the halo total mass $M$ and the galaxy's lengthscale $a_0$. Concretly, we investigate the dark matter impact on the effective potential and the photon sphere. In particular, we find that the lengthscale $a_0$ controles such potential values. Indeed, for low $a_0$ values, we find that the halo total mass $M$ decreases the potential values significantly while for high $a_0$ values such impact is diluted. Regarding the shadow aspects, we show that the shadow size is much smaller for high values of $a_0$ while the opposite effect is observed when the halo total mass $M$ is increased. By comparing our case to the slowly rotating case, we notice that the former exhibits a shadow shifted from its center to the left side. Finally, we compute the deflection angle in the weak-limit approximation and inspect the dark matter parameters influence.

Using a luminous galaxy catalog and a spherical void finding algorithm, we identify 5,078 voids at redshift $z = 0$. Within the voids, mass does not directly trace light. Instead, the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the locations of void galaxies is systematically lower than the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the dark matter (i.e., the voids are more ``devoid'' of galaxies than they are of mass). Within the voids, the integrated underdensity profiles of the dark matter and the galaxies are independent of the local background density (i.e., voids-in-voids vs.\ voids-in-clouds). Beyond the void radii, however, the integrated underdensity profiles of both the dark matter and the galaxies exhibit strong dependencies on the local background density. Compared to non-void galaxies, void galaxies are on average younger, less massive, bluer in color, less metal enriched, and have smaller radii. In addition, the specific star formation rates of void galaxies are $\sim 20$\% higher than non-void galaxies and, in the case of galaxies with central supermassive black holes with $M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 3\times 10^6 h^{-1} M_\odot$, the fraction of active void galaxies is $\sim 25$\% higher than active non-void galaxies.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

The measured parallax corresponds to a Galactocentric distance at the Sun of $R_0 = 8.5^{+1.5}_{-1.1}$ kpc. By combining the astrometric results with VERA and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) over a monitoring period of 25 years, the proper motion of Sgr A* is obtained to be $(μ_α, μ_δ) = (-3.133\pm0.003, -5.575\pm0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in equatorial coordinates, corresponding to $(μ_l, μ_b) = (-6.391\pm0.005, -0.230\pm0.004)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in Galactic coordinates.

The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process.

Due to the nontrivial structure of the Hilbert space of LGT systems, entanglement in such systems is tricky to define. However, when one limits themselves to superselection-resolved entanglement, that is, entanglement corresponding to specific gauge symmetry sectors (commonly denoted as superselection sectors), this problem disappears, and the entanglement becomes well-defined. The study of superselection-resolved entanglement is interesting in LGT for an additional reason: when the gauge symmetry is strictly obeyed, superselection-resolved entanglement becomes the only distillable contribution to the entanglement. In our work, we study the behavior of superselection-resolved entanglement in LGT systems. We employ a tensor network construction for gauge-invariant systems as defined by Zohar and Burrello (2016) and find that, in a vast range of cases, the leading term in superselection-resolved entanglement depends on the number of corners in the partition, that is, corner-law entanglement.

Our CL-AGN sample, with 107 newly identified cases, is among the largest reported to date, and includes $\sim$0.4% of the AGNs re-observed in the first year of SDSS-V operations. Among our CL-AGNs, 67% exhibit dimming while 33% exhibit brightening. Our data and sample probe extreme AGN spectral variability on timescales of months to decades, including some cases of recurring transitions on surprisingly short timescales ($\lesssim$ 2 months in the rest frame). We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower Eddington ratio ($f_{Edd}$) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a $f_{Edd}$ distribution that significantly differs from that of a redshift- and a carefully constructed, luminosity-matched control sample ($p_{KS}$ $\lesssim$ 2 $\times$ $10^{-4}$ ; median $f_{Edd}$ $\approx$ 0.025 vs. 0.043). This preference for low $f_{Edd}$ strengthens previous findings of higher CL-AGN incidence at lower Eddington ratios, found in much smaller samples of spectroscopically confirmed CL-AGNs. Finally, we show that the broad MgII emission line in our CL-AGN sample tends to vary significantly less than the broad H$β$ emission line.

  Our tests on synthetic spectra demonstrated that the obtained results are influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the input spectra. However, we accurately characterized the uncertainties, which remained below $\sim$150 K for an average S/N per pixel exceeding 20.

Observations on the massive particle surface method,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01821v1,"Ednaldo L. B. Junior, José Tarciso S. S. Junior, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Manuel E. Rodrigues, Luís F. Dias da Silva, Henrique A. Vieira","The geodesic method has played a crucial role in understanding the circular orbits generated by compact objects, culminating in the definition of the photon sphere, which was later generalized to a photon surface in arbitrary spacetimes. This new formulation extends the concept of the photon sphere in a broader sense, including dynamical spacetimes, as shown by the Vaidya solution. The photon surface essentially defines the null geodesics, which are originally tangent to the temporal surface, and keeps them confined to this surface. However, this formalism does not cover all classes of particles, and to overcome this limitation, a more comprehensive approach, denoted as the ""massive particle surface"", has been proposed that also accounts for charged massive particles. Indeed, the photon surface concept is recovered when the charge and mass of the particles are zero. In this work, we use these three formalisms to check the consistency of the results for the values of the radius of the photon sphere ($r_{ps}$) and the radius of the ""innermost stable circular orbit"" (ISCO) ($r_{\rm ISCO}$) for some gravitational models. In our results, the first model is described by conformal gravity, with the peculiarity that $g_{00}\neq-g_{11}^{-1}$. The second model, i.e. the Culetu solution, is developed by coupling General Relativity with nonlinear electrodynamics, which requires the consideration of the effective metric ($g_{\rm eff}^{μν}$) for geodesic approaches. Furthermore, we have also analysed the expressions for $r_{ps}$ and $r_{\rm ISCO}$ in a general static and spherically symmetric metric. Under these circumstances, we have found a discrepancy of $r_{ps}$ and $r_{\rm ISCO}$ obtained by the massive particle surface formalism as compared to the geodesic and photon surface formalisms.",{'geodesics': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Consequently, the fidelity of quantum gates benchmarked under pristine conditions falls short of predicting their performance in realistic circuits. To overcome this problem, we must improve their robustness against pertinent error models besides isolated fidelity. Here we report the experimental realization of robust quantum gates in superconducting quantum circuits based on a geometric framework for diagnosing and correcting various gate errors. Using quantum process tomography and randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate robust single-qubit gates against quasi-static noise and spatially-correlated noise in a broad range of strengths, which are common sources of coherent errors in large-scale quantum circuit. We also apply our method to non-static noises and to realize robust two-qubit gates.

A quatum inspired neural network for geometric modeling,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01801v2,"Weitao Du, Shengchao Liu, Xuecang Zhang","By conceiving physical systems as 3D many-body point clouds, geometric graph neural networks (GNNs), such as SE(3)/E(3) equivalent GNNs, have showcased promising performance. In particular, their effective message-passing mechanics make them adept at modeling molecules and crystalline materials. However, current geometric GNNs only offer a mean-field approximation of the many-body system, encapsulated within two-body message passing, thus falling short in capturing intricate relationships within these geometric graphs. To address this limitation, tensor networks, widely employed by computational physics to handle manybody systems using high-order tensors, have been introduced. Nevertheless, integrating these tensorized networks into the message-passing framework of GNNs faces scalability and symmetry conservation (e.g., permutation and rotation) challenges. In response, we introduce an innovative equivariant Matrix Product State (MPS)-based message-passing strategy, through achieving an efficient implementation of the tensor contraction operation. Our method effectively models complex many-body relationships, suppressing mean-field approximations, and captures symmetries within geometric graphs. Importantly, it seamlessly replaces the standard message-passing and layer-aggregation modules intrinsic to geometric GNNs. We empirically validate the superior accuracy of our approach on benchmark tasks, including predicting classical Newton systems and quantum tensor Hamiltonian matrices.

Here we study the absorption, and superradiant amplification, of a monochromatic planar wave in a charged, massive scalar field impinging on the electrically-charged Ayón-Beato-García (ABG) RBH. Comparisons are drawn with absorption and superradiance for the Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole in linear electrodynamics. We find that, in a certain parameter regime, the ABG absorption cross section is negative, due to superradiance, and moreover it is unbounded from below as the momentum of the wave approaches zero; this phenomenon of ``unbounded superradiance'' is absent in the RN case. We show how the parameter space can be divided into regions, using the bounded/unbounded and absorption/amplification boundaries. After introducing a high-frequency approximation based on particle trajectories, we calculate the absorption cross section numerically, via the partial-wave expansion, as function of wave frequency, and we present a gallery of results. The cross section of the ABG RBH is found to be larger (smaller) than in the RN case when the field charge has the same (opposite) sign as the black hole charge. We show that it is possible to find ``mimics'': situations in which the cross sections of both black holes are very similar.

Such mergers are predicted to originate in the vicinity of massive black holes (MBHs). Especially, GW190814, due to its secondary mass and mass ratio being beyond the expectations of isolated stellar evolution theories, is a promising event that has happened in an active galactic nucleus(AGN) disk. In this model, a compact object resides in the vicinity of a merging BBH. Here we report multiple pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that GW190814 is a BBH merging near a compact object. The orbital motion of BBHs around the third body produces a line-of-sight acceleration (LSA) and induces a varying Doppler shift. Using a waveform template that considers LSA, we perform Bayesian inference on a few BBH events with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC). Compared to the model for isolated BBH mergers, we obtain significantly higher network signal-to-noise ratios for GW190814 by that with the LSA and constrain the LSA to $a = 0.0014^{+0.0014}_{-0.0022} ~c~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In addition, the logarithmic Bayes factor for the LSA case over the isolated case is $16.6$, which means the LSA model is significantly preferred by the GW data.

In this paper, we consider a more general setup and treatment of islands in a $d-$dimensional AdS black hole background. The quantum fields modeling the Hawking radiation have a scale and are consistently inherited from a conformal parent theory; their symmetries are thus compatible with those of curved backgrounds. We demonstrate explicitly that the existence of islands is sensitive to the choice of CFT used to model the Hawking radiation. We compute the renormalised entanglement entropy of conformal fields on a negatively curved background in $d$ dimensions at zero temperature as well as the thermal regulated entropy of an entangling region near the UV boundary. Using the latter quantity as the entropy of the Hawking radiation, we find that islands never emerge for $d>2$.",{'hawking radiation': 3},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Generating New Spacetimes through Zermelo Navigation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01532v1,"Zonghai Li, Junji Jia","Zermelo navigation is not only a fundamental tool in Finsler geometry but also a fundamental approach to the geometrization of dynamics in physics. In this paper, we consider the Zermelo navigation problem on optical Riemannian space and, via Zermelo/Randers/spacetime triangle, explore the generation of new spacetimes from pre-existing ones. Whether the Randers metric has reversible geodesics corresponds to the presence of time-reversal symmetry in the generated spacetime. In cases where the Randers metric has reversible geodesics, we utilize a radial vector field to generate new static spacetimes from existing ones. For example, we can generate Schwarzschild, Rindler, de Sitter, and Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes from flat spacetime. In fact, the Zermelo navigation method allows for the derivation of a variety of static spacetimes from flat spacetime. For multi-parameter spacetimes, they can be generated through various navigation paths. However, for some spacetimes, not all navigation paths may exist. In the second scenario, when the Randers metric does not have reversible geodesics, we employ a rotational vector field to transform non-flat static metrics into slowly rotating spacetimes. Alternatively, using a mixed vector field, we generate slowly rotating spacetimes starting from flat spacetime. We provide examples of generating Kerr spacetimes and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes.",{'geodesics': 3},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.",{'quantum computer': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

By exploiting elements of quantum error correction, qubit toy models of this correspondence have been constructed for which the bulk logical operators are representable by operators acting on the boundary. Given a boundary subregion, wedges in the volume space are used to enclose the bulk qubits for which logical operators are reconstructable on that boundary subregion. In this thesis a number of different wedges, such as the causal wedge, greedy entanglement wedge and minimum entanglement wedge, are examined. More specifically, Monte-Carlo simulations of boundary erasure are performed with various toy models to study the differences between wedges and the effect on these wedge by the type of the model, non-uniform boundaries and stacking of models. It has been found that the minimum entanglement wedge is the best approximate for the true geometric wedge. This is illustrated by an example toy model for which an operator beyond the greedy entanglement wedge was also reconstructed. In addition, by calculating the entropy of these subregions, the viability of a mutual information wedge is rejected. Only for particular connected boundary subregions was the inclusion of the central tensor by the geometric wedge associated to a rise in mutual information.",{'AdS/CFT': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']

Future transient surveys are expected to detect several tens of thousands of TDEs, among which a small fraction may be strongly gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. In this paper, we statistically etsimate the detection rate of lensed TDEs, with dependence on the limiting magnitude of the transient all-sky surveys searching for them. We find that the requisite limiting magnitude for an all-sky transient survey to observe at least $1$ yr$^{-1}$ is $\gtrsim 21.3$, $21.2$, and $21.5$ mag in the $u$, $g$, and $z$ bands, respectively. If the limiting magnitude of the all-sky survey can reach $\sim 25-26$ mag in the $u$, $g$, and $z$ bands, the detection rate can be upto about several tens to hundreds per year. The discovery and identification of the first image of the lensed TDE can be taken as an early warning of the second and other subsequent images, which may enable detailed monitoring of the pre-peak photometry and spectroscopy evolution of the TDE.

This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties, specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures, similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex quantum systems. We conclude by considering the very low-temperature regime where there is again a maximally chaotic to regular (non-chaotic) phase transition.

To mitigate these challenges, an approach using distributed quantum neural networks has been proposed to make a prediction by approximating outputs of a large circuit using multiple small circuits. However, the approximation of a large circuit requires an exponential number of small circuit evaluations. Here, we instead propose to distribute partitioned features over multiple small quantum neural networks and use the ensemble of their expectation values to generate predictions. To verify our distributed approach, we demonstrate ten class classification of the Semeion and MNIST handwritten digit datasets.

Entanglement of edge modes in (very) strongly correlated topological insulators,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13598v2,"Nisa Ara, Rudranil Basu, Emil Mathew, Indrakshi Raychowdhury","Identifying topological phases for a strongly correlated theory remains a non-trivial task, as defining order parameters, such as Berry phases, is not straightforward. Quantum information theory is capable of identifying topological phases for a theory that exhibits quantum phase transition with a suitable definition of order parameters that are related to different entanglement measures for the system. In this work, we study entanglement entropy for a bi-layer SSH model, both in the presence and absence of Hubbard interaction and at varying interaction strengths. For the free theory, edge entanglement acts as an order parameter, which is supported by analytic calculations and numerical (DMRG) studies. We calculate the symmetry-resolved entanglement and demonstrate the equipartition of entanglement for this model which itself acts as an order parameter when calculated for the edge modes. As the DMRG calculation allows one to go beyond the free theory, we study the entanglement structure of the edge modes in the presence of on-site Hubbard interaction for the same model. A sudden reduction of edge entanglement is obtained as interaction is switched on. The explanation for this lies in the change in the size of the degenerate subspaces in the presence and absence of interaction. We also study the signature of entanglement when the interaction strength becomes extremely strong and demonstrate that the edge entanglement remains protected. In this limit, the energy eigenstates essentially become a tensor product state, implying zero entanglement. However, a remnant entropy survives in the non-trivial topological phase which is exactly due to the entanglement of the edge modes.",{'quantum information theory': 1},12.2023,2023,12,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Estimating Trotter Approximation Errors to Optimize Hamiltonian Partitioning for Lower Eigenvalue Errors,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13282v2,"Luis A. Martínez-Martínez, Prathami Divakar Kamath, Artur F. Izmaylov","One of the ways to encode many-body Hamiltonians on a quantum computer to obtain their eigen-energies through Quantum Phase Estimation is by means of the Trotter approximation. There were several ways proposed to assess the quality of this approximation based on estimating the norm of the difference between the exact and approximate evolution operators. Here, we would like to explore how these different error estimates are correlated with each other and whether they can be good predictors for the true Trotter approximation error in finding eigenvalues. For a set of small molecular systems we calculated the exact Trotter approximation errors of the first order Trotter formulas for the ground state electronic energies. Comparison of these errors with previously used upper bounds show almost no correlation over the systems and various Hamiltonian partitionings. On the other hand, building the Trotter approximation error estimation based on perturbation theory up to a second order in the time-step for eigenvalues provides estimates with very good correlations with the Trotter approximation errors. The developed perturbative estimates can be used for practical time-step and Hamiltonian partitioning selection protocols, which are paramount for an accurate assessment of resources needed for the estimation of energy eigenvalues under a target accuracy.",{'quantum computer': 1},12.2023,2023,12,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Three-body encounters in black hole discs around a supermassive black hole: The disc velocity dispersion and the Keplerian tidal field determine the eccentricity and spin-orbit alignment of gravitational wave mergers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13281v2,"Alessandro Alberto Trani, Stefano Quaini, Monica Colpi","Dynamical encounters of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in a disc of compact objects around a supermassive BH (SMBH) can accelerate the formation and coalescence of BH binaries. It has been proposed that binary-single encounters among BHs in such discs can lead to an excess of highly-eccentric BH mergers. However, previous studies have neglected how the disc velocity dispersion and the SMBH's tidal field affect the 3-body dynamics. We investigate the outcomes of binary-single encounters considering different values of the disc velocity dispersion, and examine the role of the SMBH's tidal field. We then demonstrate how their inclusion affects the properties of merging BH binaries. We perform simulations of 4-body encounters (i.e. with the SMBH as fourth particle) using the highly-accurate, regularized code TSUNAMI, which includes post-Newtonian corrections up to order 3.5PN. The disc velocity dispersion controls how orbits in the disc are aligned and circular, and determines the relative velocity of the binary-single pair before the encounter. As the velocity dispersion decreases, the eccentricity of post-encounter binaries transitions from thermal to superthermal, and binaries experience enhanced hardening. The transition between these two regimes happens at disc eccentricities and inclinations of order e ~ i ~ 10^-4. These distinct regimes correspond to a disc dominated by random motions, and one dominated by the Keplerian shear. The inclusion of the SMBH's tidal field and the disc velocity dispersion can significantly affect the number of GW mergers, and especially the number of highly-eccentric inspirals. These can be up to ~2 times higher at low velocity dispersion, and ~12 times lower at high velocity dispersions. The spin-orbit alignment is influenced by the tidal field exclusively at high velocity dispersions, effectively inhibiting the formation of anti-aligned binary BHs.",{'black holes': 1},12.2023,2023,12,['Black Holes and GR']
The role of data embedding in equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13250v2,"Sreetama Das, Stefano Martina, Filippo Caruso","Geometric deep learning refers to the scenario in which the symmetries of a dataset are used to constrain the parameter space of a neural network and thus, improve their trainability and generalization. Recently this idea has been incorporated into the field of quantum machine learning, which has given rise to equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNNs). In this work, we investigate the role of classical-to-quantum embedding on the performance of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs) for the classification of images. We discuss the connection between the data embedding method and the resulting representation of a symmetry group and analyze how changing representation affects the expressibility of an EQCNN. We numerically compare the classification accuracy of EQCNNs with three different basis-permuted amplitude embeddings to the one obtained from a non-equivariant quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN). Our results show a clear dependence of classification accuracy on the underlying embedding, especially for initial training iterations. The improvement in classification accuracy of EQCNN over non-equivariant QCNN may be present or absent depending on the particular embedding and dataset used. It is expected that the results of this work can be useful to the community for a better understanding of the importance of data embedding choice in the context of geometric quantum machine learning.",{'quantum machine learning': 2},12.2023,2023,12,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

This numerical method is particularly suited to the study of static black holes in modified gravity, where the traditional second-order, Schrödinger-like, form of the equations of motion is not always available. Our approach relies on the knowledge of the asymptotic behaviours of the perturbations near the black hole horizon and at spatial infinity, which can be obtained via the systematic algorithm that we have proposed recently. In this work, we first present our method for the perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole and show that we recover the well-know frequencies of the QNMs to a very high precision.

We study the rotating scalarized black hole solutions in the EMS model with a quartic coupling function through the spectral method numerically. The domain of existence for the scalarized BHs is presented in the spin-charge region. We found that the rotating solutions for both the two scalarized branches possess similar thermodynamic behavior compared to the static case while varying the electric charge. The BH spin enlarges the thermodynamic differences between the cold and hot branches. The profile of the metric function and the scalar field for the scalarized BHs is depicted, which demonstrates that the scalar field concentrates more on the equatorial plane in contrast to the axisymmetric region as the spin increases.",{'black holes': 2},12.2023,2023,12,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work we present the pseudospectrum of scalar perturbations on spherically-symmetric black holes in de Sitter spacetimes. We expand upon previous analyses in this setting by calculating the pseudospectrum of Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter black holes, and revisit results regarding the stability of quasinormal modes under perturbations in several cases. Of particular note is the case of scalar quasinormal modes with angular parameter $\ell=0$, which possess a zero mode related to the presence of a cosmological horizon. We show that the non-trivial eigenfunction associated to this mode has a vanishing energy norm which poses a challenge in quantifying the magnitude of external perturbations to the wave equation's potential, as well as in calculating the pseudospectrum. Nonetheless, we present results which suggest that the spectral instability manifestation of $\ell=0$ scalar quasinormal modes is qualitatively the same as in other cases, in contrast to recent claims. We also analyze the stability of the fundamental mode for $\ell\ge1$, finding it to be spectrally stable, except for certain configurations in which a perturbation leads to a discontinuous overtaking of the fundamental unperturbed purely-imaginary mode by a perturbed complex quasinormal mode.",{'black holes': 2},12.2023,2023,12,['Black Holes and GR']
The effect of stellar rotation on black hole mass and spin,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10400v2,"Sohan Ghodla, J. J.

If such black holes originate from rapidly rotating progenitors, the large angular momentum reserve in the star could drive a collapsar-like supernova explosion, hence substantially impacting these characteristics of the black holes in the binary. To examine the effect of stellar rotation on the resulting black hole mass and spin, we conduct a 1D general relativistic study of the end phase of the collapse. We find that the resulting black hole mass at times differ significantly from the previously assumed values. We quantify the dependence of the black hole spin magnitude on the hydrodynamics of the accretion flow, providing analytical relations for calculating the mass and spin based on the progenitor's pre-collapse properties. Depending on the nature of the accretion flow, our findings have implications for the black hole upper mass gap resulting from pair-instability supernovae, the maximum mass of a maximally rotating stellar black hole ($M_{\rm BH, max} \approx 35M_\odot$), and the maximum effective spin of a BBH formed in tidally locked helium star - black hole binary ($χ_{\rm eff, max} \approx 0.325$).",{'black holes': 2},12.2023,2023,12,['Black Holes and GR']

This is a consequence of level repulsion in the entanglement spectra being tied to the integrability of entanglement generated. However, such studies of the level-spacing statistics in the entanglement spectrum have thus far been limited to the output states of Clifford and Haar random circuits on product state inputs. In this work, we provide the first example of a circuit which is composed of a simulable gate set, yet has a Wigner-Dyson distributed entanglement level spectrum without any perturbing universal element. We first show that, for matchgate circuits acting on random product states, Wigner-Dyson statistics emerge by virtue of a single SWAP gate, in direct analog to previous studies on Clifford circuits. We then examine the entanglement spectrum of matchgate circuits with varied input states, and find a sharp jump in the complexity of entanglement as we go from two- to three-qubit entangled inputs. Studying Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits, we find examples of classically simulable circuits whose output states exhibit Wigner-Dyson entanglement level statistics in the absence of universal quantum gate elements. Our study thus provides strong evidence that entanglement spectrum is not strongly connected to notions of simulability in any given quantum circuit.",{'quantum circuit': 2},12.2023,2023,12,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We calculate the time evolution of the entanglement entropy between graviton and Dirac fermion fields for a separable initial state and find that it initially increases and then saturates to a finite value. Moreover, in the limit of a large number of fermions, we find a maximally entangled state between the Majorana and Dirac fields in the saturation region, implying a transition of the von Neumann algebra of observables from type I to type II.

We discuss the main properties of the models during their evolution and then focus on the final fate and the possible progenitors of jet-driven events. All tracks that undergo pulsational-pair instability produce successful gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the collapsar framework, while those that collapse directly to black holes (BH) produce jet-driven supernova events. In these latter cases, the expected black hole mass changes due to the jet propagation inside the progenitor, resulting in different models that should produce BH within the pair-instability black-hole mass gap.

A phenomenological gravitational waveform model of binary black holes incorporating horizon fluxes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17554v2,"Samanwaya Mukherjee, Sayak Datta, Khun Sang Phukon, Sukanta Bose","Subjected to the tidal field of its companion, each component of a coalescing binary suffers a slow change in its mass (tidal heating) and spin (tidal torquing) during the inspiral and merger. For black holes, these changes are associated with their absorption of energy and angular momentum fluxes. This effect modifies the inspiral rate of the binary, and consequently, the phase and amplitude of its gravitational waveform. Numerical relativity waveforms contain these effects inherently, whereas analytical approximants for the early inspiral phase have to include them manually in the energy balance equation. In this work, we construct a frequency-domain gravitational waveform model that incorporates the effects of tidal heating of black holes. This is achieved by recalibrating the inspiral phase of the waveform model IMRPhenomD to incorporate the phase corrections for tidal heating. We also include corrections to the amplitude, but add them directly to the inspiral amplitude model of IMRPhenomD. We show that the new model is faithful, with less than 1% mismatch, against a set of hybrid waveforms, except for one outlier that barely breaches this limit. The recalibrated model shows mismatches of up to $\sim 16\%$ with IMRPhenomD for high mass ratios and spins. Amplitude corrections become less significant for higher mass ratios, whereas the phase corrections leave more impact - suggesting that the former is practically irrelevant for gravitational wave data analysis in Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), Virgo and KAGRA. Comparing with a set of 219 numerical relativity waveforms, we find that the median of mismatches decreases by $\sim 4\%$ in aLIGO zero-detuned high power noise curve, and by $\sim 2\%$ with a flat noise curve.

Problems in the astrophysics of accretion onto compact celestial bodies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16013v2,Jean-Pierre Lasota,"Although during the last decade new observations and new theoretical results have brought better understanding of the physics of accretion onto compact objects, many old and several new questions and problems await answers and solutions. I show how the disc thermal-viscous instability model applied to both cataclysmic variable stars and X-ray binary transients compels us to conclude that assuming the existence in these systems of a flat accretion disc extending down to the accretor's surface or to the last stable orbit and fed with matter at its outer edge is too simple and inadequate a description of these objects. It is also clear that, in most cases, these discs cannot driven by (anomalous) viscosity only. The origin of the superhumps observed in cataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries is, contrary to the common opinion, still unknown. In accreting magnetic white dwarf systems outbursts not of the dwarf-nova type can be due to the magnetic gating instability and/or thermonuclear micronova explosions. Although the ""typical"" lightcvurves of X-ray transients can be described by analytical formulae (but their decay phase is not exponential), observations show that in many cases the light variations in these systems are much more complex. An elementary argument shows the impossibility of magnetars in pulsing ultraluminous X-ray systems, but we still do not have a complete, self-consistent description of supercritical accretion onto magnetized neutron stars and the resulting (necessarily beamed) emission. Although it is (almost) universally believed that active galactic nuclei contain accretion discs of the same type as those observed in binary systems, the evidence supporting this alleged truth is slim and the structure of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes is still to be determined.",{'black holes': 1},11.2023,2023,11,['Black Holes and GR']

On quantum channels that destroy negative conditional entropy,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15705v2,"PV Srinidhi, Indranil Chakrabarty, Samyadeb Bhattacharya, Nirman Ganguly","Counter-intuitive to classical notions, quantum conditional entropy can be negative, playing a pivotal role in information-processing tasks. This article delves deeply into quantum channels, emphasizing negative conditional entropy breaking channels (NCEB) and introducing negative conditional entropy annihilating channels (NCEA). We characterize these channels from both topological and information-theoretic perspectives, examining their properties when combined serially and NCEB in parallel. Our exploration extends to complimentary channels associated with NCEB, leading to the introduction of information-leaking channels. Utilizing the parameters of the standard depolarizing channel, we provide tangible examples and further characterization. We demonstrate the relationship of NCEB and NCEA with newly introduced channels like coherent information breaking (CIB) and mutual information breaking (MIB), along with standard channels like zero capacity channels. Preservation of quantum resources is an integral constituent of quantum information theory. Recognizing this, we lay prescriptions to detect channels that do not break the negativity of conditional entropy, ensuring the conservation of this quantum resource.",{'quantum information theory': 1},11.2023,2023,11,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In this code, quantum information is encoded through quantum geometry, and any local errors or erasures in any finite region, no matter how large, may be diagnosed and corrected.

Our theory admits the Reissner-Nordström solution at the scalar vacuum of the theory ($φ=0$) and we find that the higher order derivative gauge field correction term results in the tachyonic instability of our system once the coupling function satisfies the condition that its second derivative is positive at the scalar vacuum in the appropriate parameter space. We find that the branches do not end with an extremal black hole, rather with a singularity as indicated by the divergence of the Kretschmann scalar. The black holes can be overcharged in the sense that they may carry larger electric charge in comparison to their mass. Finally, these solutions possess larger entropy at the event horizon radius when compared to the Reissner-Nordström black hole, as well as to scalarized black holes without the higher order derivative gauge field terms, indicating in this way the thermodynamic prefer-ability of our system, when compared to existing literature, while they respect the energy conditions.",{'black holes': 2},11.2023,2023,11,['Black Holes and GR']
Delayed X-ray brightening accompanied by variable ionized absorption following a tidal disruption event,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09371v2,"T. Wevers, M. Guolo, D. R. Pasham, E. R. Coughlin, F. Tombesi, Y. Yao, S. Gezari","Supermassive black holes can experience super-Eddington peak mass fallback rates following the tidal disruption of a star. The theoretical expectation is that part of the infalling material is expelled by means of an accretion disk wind, whose observational signature includes blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized species in X-ray spectra. To date, however, only one such ultra-fast outflow (UFO) has been reported in the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. Here we report on the discovery of transient absorption-like signatures in X-ray spectra of the TDE AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk (at a redshift of $z$=0.092), following an X-ray brightening $\sim 230$ days after UV/optical peak. We find that while no statistically significant absorption features are present initially, they appear on a timescale of several days, and remain detected up to 770 days after peak. Simple thermal continuum models, combined with a power-law or neutral absorber, do not describe these features well. Adding a partial covering, low velocity ionized absorber improves the fit at early times, but fails at late times. A high velocity (v$_w$ $\sim$ 42000 km s$^{-1}$, or -0.15c), ionized absorber (ultra-fast outflow) provides a good fit to all data. The few day timescale of variability is consistent with expectations for a clumpy wind. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the X-ray delay, as well as the potential for larger scale wind feedback. The serendipitous nature of the discovery could suggest a high incidence of UFOs in TDEs, alleviating some of the tension with theoretical expectations.",{'black holes': 1},11.2023,2023,11,['Black Holes and GR']
Determining cosmological growth parameter for stellar-mass black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09007v2,"Ema Mlinar, Tomaž Zwitter","It has recently been suggested that black holes (BHs) may grow with time, so that their mass is proportional to the cosmological scale factor to the power $n$, with suggested values $n \approx 3$ for supermassive BHs in elliptical galaxies. Here we test these predictions with stellar mass BHs in X-ray binaries using their masses and ages. We perform two sets of tests to assess the compatible values of $n$. First, we assume that no compact object grows over the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof limit which marks the borderline between neutron stars and BHs. We show that half of BHs would be born with a mass below this limit if $n=3$ applies. The possibility that all BHs were born above the limit is rejected at $4\,σ$ if $n=3$ applies. In the second test, we assume that masses of BHs at their formation stay the same over cosmic history. We compare the mass distribution of the youngest BHs, which could have not grown yet, to their older counterparts. Distributions are compatible for $n = -0.9^{+1.3}_{-4.6}$, with $n=3$ excluded formally with 87 % confidence. This result may be biased, because massive BHs tend to have a massive companion. Correcting for this bias yields $n\approx 0$. We can therefore conclude that while our results are not a clear rejection of BH scaling with $n=3$, we show that $n=0$ is much more consistent with the data.",{'black holes': 1},11.2023,2023,11,['Black Holes and GR']
Regularizing Parameterized Black Hole Spacetimes with Kerr Symmetries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08659v2,"Kent Yagi, Samantha Lomuscio, Tristen Lowrey, Zack Carson","Parameterized Kerr spacetimes allow us to test the nature of black holes in model-independent ways. Such spacetimes contain several arbitrary functions and, as a matter of practicality, one Taylor expands them about infinity and keeps only to finite orders in the expansion. In this paper, we focus on the parameterized spacetime preserving Killing symmetries of a Kerr spacetime and show that an unphysical divergence may appear in the metric if such a truncation is performed in the series expansion. To remedy this, we redefine the arbitrary functions so that the divergence disappears, at least for several known black hole solutions that can be mapped to the parameterized Kerr spacetime. We propose two restricted classes of the refined parameterized Kerr spacetime that only contain one or two arbitrary functions and yet can reproduce exactly all the example black hole spacetimes considered in this paper. The Petrov class of the parameterized Kerr spacetime is of type I while that for the restricted class with one arbitrary function remains type D.

Self Dual Black Holes as the Hydrogen Atom,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07933v2,"Alfredo Guevara, Uri Kol","Rotating black holes exhibit a remarkable set of hidden symmetries near their horizon. These hidden symmetries have been shown to determine phenomena such as absorption scattering, superradiance and more recently tidal deformations, also known as Love numbers. They have also led to a proposal for a dual thermal CFT with left and right movers recovering the entropy of the black hole.
  In this work we provide a constructive explanation of these hidden symmetries via analytic continuation to Klein signature. We first show that the near-horizon region of extremal black holes is a Kleinian static solution with mass $M$ and NUT charge $N$. We then analyze the self-dual solution, namely a Kerr black hole with a NUT charge $N=\pm M$. Remarkably, the self-dual solution is self-similar to its near-horizon region and hence approximate symmetries become exact: in particular, the original two isometries of Kerr are promoted to seven exact symmetries embedded in a conformal algebra. We analyze its full conformal group in Kleinian twistor space, where a breaking $SO(4,2) \to SL(2,\mathbb{R})\times SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ occurs due to the insertion of a preferred time direction for the black hole. Finally, we show that the spectrum of the self-dual black hole is integrable and that the eigenvalue problem can be mapped exactly to the Hydrogen atom where the wavefunction is solved in terms of elementary polynomials. Perturbing to astrophysical black holes with $N=0$, we obtain a hyperfine splitting structure.",{'black holes': 3},11.2023,2023,11,['Black Holes and GR']

West, Jamie Heredge, Martin Sevior, Muhammad Usman","Exploiting the power of quantum computation to realise superior machine learning algorithmshas been a major research focus of recent years, but the prospects of quantum machine learning (QML) remain dampened by considerable technical challenges. A particularly significant issue is that generic QML models suffer from so-called barren plateaus in their training landscapes -- large regions where cost function gradients vanish exponentially in the number of qubits employed, rendering large models effectively untrainable. A leading strategy for combating this effect is to build problem-specific models which take into account the symmetries of their data in order to focus on a smaller, relevant subset of Hilbert space. In this work, we introduce a family of rotationally equivariant QML models built upon the quantum Fourier transform, and leverage recent insights from the Lie-algebraic study of QML models to prove that (a subset of) our models do not exhibit barren plateaus. In addition to our analytical results we numerically test our rotationally equivariant models on a dataset of simulated scanning tunnelling microscope images of phosphorus impurities in silicon, where rotational symmetry naturally arises, and find that they dramatically outperform their generic counterparts in practice.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},11.2023,2023,11,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

To address this, hybrid transfer learning solutions have been developed, merging pre-trained classical models, capable of handling extensive inputs, with variational quantum circuits. Yet, it remains unclear how much each component -- classical and quantum -- contributes to the model's results. We propose a novel hybrid architecture: instead of utilizing a pre-trained network for compression, we employ an autoencoder to derive a compressed version of the input data. This compressed data is then channeled through the encoder part of the autoencoder to the quantum component. We assess our model's classification capabilities against two state-of-the-art hybrid transfer learning architectures, two purely classical architectures and one quantum architecture. Their accuracy is compared across four datasets: Banknote Authentication, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, MNIST digits, and AudioMNIST.

We attempt to impose constraints on microscopic quantum states to match with the macroscopic phenomenon of the charge radiation during black hole evaporation. Specifically, we consider a simple qubit system with conserved spin/charge serving as a toy model for the evaporation of charged black holes. We propose refined rules for selecting a random state with conserved quantities to simulate the distribution of charges during the different stages of evaporation, and obtain refined Page curves that exhibit distinct features in contrast to the original Page curve.

In this work we demonstrate the existence of black hole solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and develop a relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass. We have used observed bound on the freezeout temperature to constrain scalaron mass range by modifying the cosmic expansion rate at the BBN epoch. The mass range of primordial black holes (PBHs) which are astrophysical dark matter candidates is deduced. The range of scalaron mass which does not spoil the BBN era is found to be $10^{-16}-10^4 \text{ eV}$ for both relativistic and non-relativistic scalarons. The window $10^{-16}-10^{-14}$ eV of scalaron mass obtained from solar system constraint on PPN parameter is compatible with the BBN bound derived in this work. The PBH mass range is obtained as $10^6-10^{-14}\text{ }M_{\odot}$. Scalarons constrained by BBN are also eligible to accommodate axion like dark matter particles. The problem of ultra-light PBHs ($M \le 10^{-24} \text{ }M_\odot$) not constrained by the present study of BBN is still open. Estimation of deuterium (D) fraction and relative D+$^3$He abundance in the $f(R)$ gravity scenario shows that the BBN history mimics that of general relativity.

We show that the evolution of an eccentric binary can be reduced that of effective source on quasi-circular orbits, coupled to a post-Newtonian prescription for the secular evolution of the eccentricity. Our findings unveil an interplay between precession and eccentricity: the spins of eccentric binaries precess on shorter timescales and their nutation amplitude is altered compared to black holes on quasi-circular orbits, consequently affecting the so-called spin morphology. Even if binaries circularize by the time they enter the sensitivity window of our detectors, their spin orientations retain some memory of the past evolution on eccentric orbits, thus providing a new link between gravitational-wave detection and astrophysical formation.

We integrate the motion of two sBH initially on circular orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), and evaluate the probability of binary formation under various conditions. We find that both models of DF (with different dependence of the frictional coefficient on $|Δ{\bf v}|$) can foster the formation of binaries when the effective friction timescale $τ$ satisfies $Ω_{\rm K}τ\lesssim 20-30$ (where $Ω_{\rm K}$ is the Keplerian frequency around the SMBH): prograde binaries are formed when the DF is stronger (smaller $τ$), while retrograde binaries dominate when the DF is weaker (larger $τ$). We determine the distribution of both prograde and retrograde binaries as a function of initial orbital separation and the DF strength. Using our models of DF, we show that for a given sBH number density in the AGN disk, the formation rate of sBH binaries increases with decreasing $τ$ and can reach a moderate value with a sufficiently strong DF.",{'black holes': 1},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']
Horizonless black hole mimickers with spin,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12148v2,"Ulf Danielsson, Suvendu Giri","In this paper, we study rotating horizon less black shells as an alternative to Kerr black holes. We make use of Ernst's potential to solve the Einstein equations perturbatively in the angular momentum $a$. Calculating to order $a^6$, we find accurate predictions up to about $a=0.45$, where the quadrupole moment is predicted to be around $1\%$ higher than its Kerr value; higher multipole moments show deviation of the order of $\sim 10\%$. Our analysis takes into account deformations of the black shells, and we propose that it can be used for numerical simulations comparing gravitational waves emitted by orbiting black shells with those emitted by orbiting black holes. In our analysis, we make extensive use of relativistic hydrodynamics, and discover an intricate structure of circulating flows of fluid and heat on the black shell, sustained by the Unruh effect.","{'black holes': 2, 'einstein equations': 1}",10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']

One family can be described by the Bardeen-like metrics, and the other by the Simpson-Visser metric. We compute the spectrum of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of these spacetimes enlightening a common misunderstanding regarding this computation present in the recent literature. In both families, we observe long-living modes for values of the regularization parameter corresponding to ultracompact, horizonless configurations. Such modes appear to be associated with the presence of a stable photon sphere and are indicative of potential non-linear instabilities. In general, the QNM spectra of both families display deviations from the standard spectrum of GR singular BHs. In order to address the future detectability of such deviations in the gravitational-wave ringdown signal, we perform a preliminary study, finding that third generation ground-based detectors might be sensible to macroscopic values of the regularization parameter.",{'black holes': 1},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']
Constraints on charged black holes from merger-ringdown signals in GWTC-3 and prospects for the Einstein Telescope,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10447v2,"Hua-Peng Gu, Hai-Tian Wang, Lijing Shao","Whether astrophysical black holes (BHs) can have charge is a question to be addressed by observations. In the era of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, one can constrain the charge of a merged BH remnant using the merger-ringdown signal of the GW data. Extending earlier studies, we analyze five GW events in GWTC-3, assuming Kerr-Newman BHs. Our results show no strong evidence for a charged BH, and give a limit on the charge-to-mass-ratio $Q<0.37$ at $90\%$ credible level (CL). Due to the charge-spin degeneracy in the waveform and the limited signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), it is challenging for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observations to provide better constraints. We further simulate data for the Einstein Telescope (ET), where SNRs can be as large as $\sim270$ in the ringdown signal. These simulated events allow us to consider the 220, 221, and 330 ringdown modes altogether, which can help break the charge-spin degeneracy. The analysis of a simulated GW150914-like signal shows that ET can improve the constraints on the charge-to-mass-ratio to $Q \lesssim 0.2$ at $90\%$ CL with one ringdown signal.",{'black holes': 1},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']
Efficient Representation of Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States in two dimensions via Projected Entangled Pair States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08533v2,"Aritra Sinha, Marek M.

In this article, we use the Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) ansatz as to represent METTS on a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. While Matrix Product States (MPS) are less efficient for 2D systems due to their complexity growing exponentially with the lattice size, PEPS provide a more tractable approach. To substantiate the prowess of PEPS in modeling METTS (dubbed as PEPS-METTS), we benchmark it against the purification method for the 2D quantum Ising model at its critical temperature. Our analysis reveals that PEPS-METTS achieves accurate long-range correlations with significantly lower bond dimensions. We further corroborate this finding in the 2D Fermi Hubbard model at half-filling. At a technical level, we introduce an efficient \textit{zipper} method to obtain PEPS boundary matrix product states needed to compute expectation values.

A fast test for the identification and confirmation of massive black hole binaries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06896v2,"Massimo Dotti, Fabio Rigamonti, Stefano Rinaldi, Walter Del Pozzo, Roberto Decarli, Riccardo Buscicchio","We present a new observational test to identify massive black hole binaries in large multi-epoch spectroscopical catalogues and to probe the real nature of already proposed binary candidates. The test is tailored for binaries with separations large enough to allow each black hole to retain its own broad line region. In this limit the fast AGN variability typically observed over months cannot be associated to the much longer binary period, and it is assumed (as for the case of single black holes) to be the consequence of the evolution of the innermost regions of the two accretion discs. A simple analysis of the cross-correlation between different parts of individual broad emission lines can therefore identify the presence of two massive black holes whose continua vary independently of each other. Our analysis indicates that to be less affected by the noise in the spectra the broad lines should be divided in two close-to-equal-flux parts. This ensures that in the single massive black hole scenario the cross-correlation will always be high. With monitoring campaigns similar to those performed for reverberation mapping studies, on the other way, a binary can show any value of the cross-correlation and can therefore be distinguished from a standard AGN. The new test can be performed over timescales orders of magnitude shorter than the alternative tests already discussed in literature, and can be a powerful complement to the massive black hole binary search strategies already in place.",{'black holes': 2},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']

The birefringence phenomena arising from the axion-photon coupling can be negligible in the weak coupling approximation because the leading-order contributions to the equations of motion come from the square term of the coupling parameter. We find that the coupling parameter makes the size of shadows slightly increase for arbitrary spin parameter. For the rapid rotating black hole case with a larger coupling, we find that there exist a pedicel-like structure appeared in the left of the D-type like shadows.Comparing the shadow size of the Kerr black hole with the shadow size of the Sgr A* and M87* black holes, we find that there is room for such a theoretical model of the axion-photon coupling.",{'black holes': 1},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']

Emergence of Species Scale Black Hole Horizons,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04488v3,"José Calderón-Infante, Matilda Delgado, Angel M. Uranga","The scale at which quantum gravity becomes manifest, the species scale $Λ_s$, has recently been argued to take values parametrically lower than the Planck scale. We use black holes of vanishing horizon area (small black holes) in effective field theories coupled to quantum gravity to shed light on how the three different physical manifestations of the species scale $Λ_s$ relate to each other. (i) Near the small black hole core, a scalar field runs to infinite distance in moduli space, a regime in which the Swampland Distance Conjecture predicts a tower of exponentially light states, which lower $Λ_s$. (ii) We integrate out modes in the tower and generate via Emergence a set of higher derivative corrections, showing that $Λ_s$ is the scale at which such terms become relevant. (iii) Finally, higher derivative terms modify the black hole solution and grant it a non-zero, species scale sized stretched horizon of radius $Λ_s^{-1}$, showcasing the species scale as the size of the smallest possible black hole describable in the effective theory. We present explicit 4d examples of small black holes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity, and the 10d example of type IIA D0-branes. The emergence of the species scale horizon for D0-branes requires a non-trivial interplay of different 8-derivative terms in type IIA and M-theory, providing a highly non-trivial check of our unified description of the different phenomena associated to the species scale.",{'black holes': 3},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']
Unification of the Fundamental Forces in Higher-Order Differential Geometry,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04214v2,William Bies,"Riemannian geometry is generalized to allow infinitesimals to any order. In the differential calculus, it is shown how to extend the affine connection to enable parallel transport in the direction of a higher tangent vector, while on the integral side, a theory of integration adapted to integrands possibly of higher than first order in the differentials is developed. The curvature tensor generalizes naturally in order to describe how space can curve along higher tangents. These elegant ideas stand on their own as a discovery in pure mathematics, independent of whatever fate they may encounter when applied to physics, where one expects novel phenomena rooted in interactions among infinitesimals differing in order (never before studied). Free fall must now be described by geodesics in a higher sense and Einstein's field equations acquire a hierarchy of higher sectors. As soon as one goes to second order, a profound revision of the concept of inertia is called for which manifests itself on the phenomenological level as a modified Newtonian dynamics obeyed by spacecraft in the solar system (thereby explaining the flyby anomaly). A second major implication is to open a path to field-theoretical unification on the classical level in the spirit of Einstein. The present theory leads immediately to another fundamental force arising at each successive order in the jets. The 1-jet case reduces to gravity as known in the conventional general theory of relativity, of course. It is striking that, at the 2-jet level, one recovers the electroweak forces including spontaneous symmetry breaking from a single postulate, the proper generalization of the equivalence principle. At the 3-jet level, following the same procedure we obtain chromodynamics without any ad hoc modifications. In future work, we hope to analyze the 4-jet level and its implications for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.",{'geodesics': 1},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']

Carneiro","Polymer models inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) have been used to describe non-singular quantum black holes with spherical symmetry, with the classical singularity replaced by a transition from a black hole to a white hole. A recent model, with a single polymerisation parameter, leads to a symmetric transition with same mass for the black and white phases, and to an asymptotically flat exterior metric. The radius of the transition surface is, however, not fixed, increasing with the mass. Following similar procedures, in a previous paper we have fixed that radius by identifying the minimal area on the transition surface with the area gap of LQG. This allowed to find a dependence of the polymerisation parameter on the black hole mass, with the former increasing as the latter decreases. It also permitted to extend the model to Planck scale black holes, with quantum fluctuations remaining small at the horizon. In the present paper we extend this analysis to charged black holes, showing that the Cauchy horizon lies beyond of the transition surface. We also show the existence of limiting states with zero surface gravity, the lightest one with $Q = 0$ and $m = \sqrt{2}/4$, and the heaviest with $Q = m = \sqrt{2}/2$.

Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15897v3,"Jonah Kudler-Flam, Samuel Leutheusser, Gautam Satishchandran","It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of ""semi-classical"" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor ""localized"" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another ""boundary structure"" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.",{'black holes': 3},09.2023,2023,09,['Black Holes and GR']

We perform two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations using the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code JET with its radiation treatment module. We study the impact of black hole mass, accretion efficiency, and inclination between the orbital and spin planes. From our results, we identified two behaviours: $i)$ models with low-mass black holes ($M_\text{h}\sim10^6~\text{M}_{\odot}$), low inclination ($i\sim0$), and low accretion efficiency ($η\sim0.01$) show light curves with a short early peak caused by the interaction of the wind with the inner edge of the stream. The line of sight has little effect on the light curve, since the stream covers a small fraction of the solid angle due to the precession occurring in the orbital plane; $ii)$ models with high-mass black holes ($M_\text{h}\gtrsim10^7~\text{M}_{\odot}$), high inclination ($i\sim90^{\circ}$), and high accretion efficiency ($η\sim0.1$) produce light curves with luminosity peaks that can be delayed by up to 50-100 d depending on the line of sight due to presence of the precessed stream blocking the radiation in the early phase of the event.

Geometrically Taming Dynamical Entanglement Growth in Purified Quantum States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07961v2,"Tim Pokart, Carl Lehmann, Jan Carl Budich","Entanglement properties of purified quantum states are of key interest for two reasons. First, in quantum information theory, minimally entangled purified states define the Entanglement of Purification as a fundamental measure for the complexity of the corresponding physical mixed state. Second, dynamical entanglement growth in purified states represents the main bottleneck for calculating dynamical physical properties on classical computers in the framework of tensor network states. Here, we demonstrate how geometric methods including parallel transport may be harnessed to reduce such dynamical entanglement growth, and to obtain a general prescription for maintaining (locally) optimal entanglement entropy when time-evolving a purified state. Adapting and extending by higher order skew corrections the notion of Uhlmann geometric phases, we reveal the relation between dynamical entanglement growth and the geometry of the Hilbert-Schmidt bundle as the mathematical foundation of purified states. With benchmarks on a non-integrable spin chain model, we compare the computational performance of matrix product state algorithms based on our present geometric disentangling method to previous approaches for taming entanglement growth in purified states. Our findings provide numerical evidence that geometric disentanglers are a powerful approach for disentangling purified states in an extended physical parameter regime.

Measuring Black Hole Spins through X-ray Reflection Spectroscopy and the Relativistic Precession Model: the case of XTE J1859+226,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05018v2,"Gitika Mall, Honghui Liu, Cosimo Bambi, James F. Steiner, Javier A. Garcia","The development of techniques to measure accurately black hole spins is crucial to study the physics and astrophysics of these objects. X-ray reflection spectroscopy is currently the most popular method to estimate the spins of accreting black holes; so far it has provided a spin measurement of about 40 stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries and 40 supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. The relativistic precession model (RPM) is another method to measure the spins of stellar-mass black holes: it requires the measurement of the frequencies of three simultaneous quasi-periodic oscillations and can potentially provide precise estimates of the black hole mass and spin. However, the two methods do not seem to provide consistent results when applied to the same sources, which questions the reliability and accuracy of these measurements. Recently, the RPM has been applied to infer the spin of the black hole in XTE J1859+226. The authors found $a_* = 0.149 \pm 0.005$ (68% CL). There are no other spin measurements of this source. We looked for archived RXTE observations of XTE J1859+226 with blurred reflection features and found 23 spectra suitable for measuring the spin. We employed two different models with relxill and relxillD and obtained a higher spin value from all these fits. From simultaneous fitting of 7 spectra of higher quality, we found $a_* = 0.986^{+0.001}_{-0.004}$ and $a_* =0.987 \pm 0.003$ (90% CL, statistical) with relxill and relxillD, respectively. Our results confirm the discrepancy between the spin measurements inferred from the two techniques.",{'black holes': 4},09.2023,2023,09,['Black Holes and GR']

Targeted Search for Gravitational Waves from Highly Spinning Light Compact Binaries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16173v3,"Yi-Fan Wang, Alexander H.

While previous searches targeted sources that are representative of observed neutron star binaries in the galaxy, it is already known that neutron stars can regularly be spun up to a dimensionless spin of $\sim0.4$, and in principle reach up to $\sim0.7$ before breakup would occur. Furthermore, there may be primordial black hole binaries or exotic formation mechanisms to produce light black holes. In these cases, it is possible for the binary constituent to be spun up beyond that achievable by a neutron star. A single detection of this type of source would reveal a novel formation channel for compact-binaries. To determine if there is evidence for any such sources, we use PyCBC to conduct a targeted search of LIGO and Virgo data for light compact objects with high spin. Our analysis detects previously known observations GW170817 and GW200115; however, we report no additional mergers.

We compare the effects of a dark matter spike to those expected from a galactic halo of the same mass. The radial pressure is shown to be negligible for both the spike and the halo, implying that there is no difference between the isotropic case and the anisotropic case. Our calculation for the halo starts from the Hernquist density function for which the corresponding metric can be obtained analytically in closed form. The effect of the spike is orders of magnitude more significant than the halo as long as the distribution scale of the latter is within a few orders of magnitude of the value expected from observations. Our results indicate that the impact of the spike surrounding M87* on the ringdown waveform may in principle be detectable.

In this manuscript, we explore a practical near-term use of local random quantum circuits in dimensional reduction of large low-rank data sets. We make use of the well-studied dimensionality reduction technique called the random projection method. This method has been extensively used in various applications such as image processing, logistic regression, entropy computation of low-rank matrices, etc. We prove that the matrix representations of local random quantum circuits with sufficiently shorter depths ($\sim O(n)$) serve as good candidates for random projection. We demonstrate numerically that their projection abilities are not far off from the computationally expensive classical principal components analysis on MNIST and CIFAR-100 image data sets. We also benchmark the performance of quantum random projection against the commonly used classical random projection in the tasks of dimensionality reduction of image datasets and computing Von Neumann entropies of large low-rank density matrices. And finally using variational quantum singular value decomposition, we demonstrate a near-term implementation of extracting the singular vectors with dominant singular values after quantum random projecting a large low-rank matrix to lower dimensions. All such numerical experiments unequivocally demonstrate the ability of local random circuits to randomize a large Hilbert space at sufficiently shorter depths with robust retention of properties of large datasets in reduced dimensions.",{'random quantum circuits': 3},08.2023,2023,08,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In doing so, we numerically solve the governing equations that describe the flow motion around the compact objects in a general relativistic framework, where spin ($a_{k}$) and deformation parameters ($\varepsilon$) demonstrate the nature of the central source, namely black hole (BH) or naked singularity (NS). With this, we obtain all possible classes of global accretion solutions ($i. e.$, O, A, W and I-type) by varying the energy ($E$) and angular momentum ($λ$) of the relativistic accretion flow, and examine the role of thermal bremsstrahlung emission in studying the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the accretion disc. We divide the parameter space in $λ-E$ plane in terms of the different classes of accretion solutions for BH and NS models. We further calculate the disc luminosity ($L$) corresponding to these accretion solutions, and observe that I-type solutions yield higher $L$ and SEDs than the remaining types of solutions for both BH and NS models. For BH model, SEDs for W and I-type solutions differ significantly from the results for O and A-type solutions for low $E$ values. On the contrary, for NS model, SEDs for different accretion solutions are identical in the whole parameter space of $λ$ and $E$. We also examine the effect of $\varepsilon$ on the SEDs and observe that a non-Kerr BH yields higher SEDs than the usual Kerr BH. Finally, for accretion solutions of identical $E$ and $λ$, we compare the SEDs obtained from BH and NS models, and find that naked singularity objects produce more luminous power spectra than the black holes.",{'black holes': 1},08.2023,2023,08,['Black Holes and GR']
Evolution of eccentric stellar disks around supermassive black holes: the complex disk disruption dynamics and the milliparsec stars,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12344v2,"Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab","We study the 10 Myr evolution of parsec-scale stellar disks with initial masses of $M_{\mathrm{disk}} = 1.0$ - $7.5 \times 10^4 M_\odot$ and eccentricities $e_\mathrm{init}=0.1$-$0.9$ around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Our disk models are embedded in a spherical background potential and have top-heavy single and binary star initial mass functions (IMF) with slopes of $0.25$-$1.7$. The systems are evolved with the N-body code $\texttt{BIFROST}$ including post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion and simplified stellar evolution. All disks are unstable and evolve on Myr timescales towards similar eccentricity distributions peaking at $e_\star \sim 0.3$-$0.4$. Models with high $e_\mathrm{init}$ also develop a very eccentric $(e_\star\gtrsim0.9)$ stellar population. For higher disk masses $M_\mathrm{disk} \gtrsim3 \times10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$, the disk disruption dynamics is more complex than the standard secular eccentric disk instability with opposite precession directions at different disk radii - a precession direction instability. We present an analytical model describing this behavior. A milliparsec population of $N\sim10$-$100$ stars forms around the SMBH in all models. For low $e_\mathrm{init}$ stars migrate inward while for $e_\mathrm{init}\gtrsim0.6$ stars are captured by the Hills mechanism. Without PN, after $6$ Myr the captured stars have a sub-thermal eccentricity distribution. We show that including PN effects prevents this thermalization by suppressing resonant relaxation effects and cannot be ignored.

In this paper, we find that when the speed of sound decreases suddenly, the curvature perturbations becomes scale dependent in the infrared limit and the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation only has a $k^2$ growth. Furthermore, by studying the evolution of the power spectrum in the inflation model, in which both the sound speed of the curvature perturbations and the rolling speed of the inflaton are reduced, we find that the power spectrum is nearly scale invariant at the large scales to satisfy the constraint from the cosmic microwave background radiation observations, and at the same time can be enhanced at the small scales to result in an abundant formation of primordial black holes. In the cases of the simultaneous changes of the sound speed and the slow-roll parameter $η$ and the change of the sound speed preceding that of the slow-roll parameter $η$, the power spectrum can possess a $k^6$ growth under certain conditions, which is the steepest growth of the power spectrum reported so far.",{'black holes': 2},08.2023,2023,08,['Black Holes and GR']

In this paper, we investigate the capture process using analytical and numerical approaches. We discover a new constant integral of motion for one object's capture process. Applying this result to the whole population of the nuclei cluster captured by the AGN disk, we find that the population of captured objects depends on the angular density and eccentricity distribution of the nuclei clusters and is effectively independent of the radial density profile of the nuclei cluster and disk models. An isotropic nuclei cluster with thermal eccentricity distribution predicts a captured profile $d N/d r \propto r^{-1/4}$. The captured objects are found to be dynamically crowded within the disk.

Resolving the eccentricity of stellar mass binary black holes with next generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07565v2,Pankaj Saini,"Next generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect $\sim 10^4 \mbox{-} 10^5$ binary black holes (BBHs) per year. Understanding the formation pathways of these binaries is an open question. Orbital eccentricity can be used to distinguish between the formation channels of compact binaries, as different formation channels are expected to yield distinct eccentricity distributions. Due to the rapid decay of eccentricity caused by the emission of GWs, measuring smaller values of eccentricity poses a challenge for current GW detectors due to their limited sensitivity. In this study, we explore the potential of next generation GW detectors such as Voyager, Cosmic Explorer (CE), and Einstein Telescope (ET) to resolve the eccentricity of BBH systems. Considering a GWTC-3 like population of BBHs and assuming some fiducial eccentricity distributions as well as an astrophysically motivated eccentricity distribution (Zevin et $al.$ (2021)), we calculate the fraction of detected binaries that can be confidently distinguished as eccentric. We find that for Zevin eccentricity distribution, Voyager, CE, and ET can confidently measure the non-zero eccentricity for $\sim 3\%$, $9\%$, and $13\%$ of the detected BBHs, respectively. In addition to the fraction of resolvable eccentric binaries, our findings indicate that Voyager, CE, and ET require typical minimum eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.02$, $5\times 10^{-3}$, and $10^{-3}$ at $10$ Hz GW frequency, respectively, to identify a BBH system as eccentric. The better low-frequency sensitivity of ET significantly enhances its capacity to accurately measure eccentricity.",{'black holes': 1},08.2023,2023,08,['Black Holes and GR']

Efficient accretion of the surrounding gas onto such DCBH seeds may render them sufficiently bright for detection with the JWST up to $z\approx 20$. Additionally, the very steep and red spectral slope predicted across the $\approx 1$-5 $μ$m wavelength range of the JWST/NIRSpec instrument during their initial growth phase should make them photometrically identifiable up to very high redshifts. In this work, we present a search for such DCBH candidates across the 34 arcmin$^{2}$ in the first two spokes of the JWST cycle-1 PEARLS survey of the north ecliptic pole time-domain field covering eight NIRCam filters down to a maximum depth of $\sim$ 29 AB mag. We identify two objects with spectral energy distributions consistent with the Pacucci et al. (2016) DCBH models. However, we also note that even with data in eight NIRCam filters, objects of this type remain degenerate with dusty galaxies and obscured active galactic nuclei over a wide range of redshifts. Follow-up spectroscopy would be required to pin down the nature of these objects. Based on our sample of DCBH candidates and assumptions on the typical duration of the DCBH steep-slope state, we set a conservative upper limit of $\lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ comoving Mpc$^{-3}$ (cMpc$^{-3}$) on the comoving density of host halos capable of hosting DCBHs with spectral energy distributions similar to the Pacucci et al.

In this paper, we derive a new spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo, and then explore the effects of the pseudo-isothermal halo profile on a rotating black hole at the M87 galactic center, aiming to achieve a black hole solution that aligns with those found in the real universe. Using the Newman-Janis method, we derive a rotating black hole solution encompassed by the pseudo-isothermal halo, which is consistent with observations of actual black holes that are believed to possess spin. Our investigation focuses on the impact of the pseudo-isothermal halo on the black hole event horizon, time-like and null orbits, as well as the black hole shadow. We find that as the spin parameter $a$ increases, the interval between the inner event horizon and the outer event horizon of the rotating black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal halo in M87 diminishes. This leads to the formation of an extreme black hole. The presence of dark matter, however, has minimal effect on the event horizon. Moreover, in the M87 as the spin parameter $a$ increases, the black hole shadow deviates increasingly from a standard circle, with larger spin parameters causing more pronounced distortion relative to the standard circle. Surprisingly, we observe that the dark matter density has very little influence on the shadow of the black hole surrounded by the pseudo-isothermal halo in the M87.

We develop Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators, a full fermionic analog of TEMPO, that can directly manipulates Grassmann path integrals with similar numerical cost as the bosonic counterpart. We further propose a zipup algorithm to compute expectation values on the fly without explicitly building a single large augmented density tensor, which boosts our efficiency on top of the vanilla TEMPO. Our method has a favorable complexity scaling over existing tensor network methods, and we demonstrate its performance on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the single impurity Anderson models.

To develop quantum information and computation tasks fully, one must inevitably take into account the relativistic effects. In this regard, the spin is one of the central tools. For this purpose, it is of paramount importance to understand and characterize fully the theory of spin in relativistic quantum information theory where the spin states act as qubit. This area is still far from being resolved. As a result, this article will explore the recent studies of the concepts of the spin and spin quantum correlations in inertial frames and some apparent paradoxes regarding this concept. We will mainly focus on the problem of characterizing the spin, reduced spin density matrices and spin quantum correlations in inertial reference frames and the apparent paradoxes involved therein. Another important aspect is the use of tools of quantum field theory to extend several concepts in non-relativistic domain to relativistic one.

Constraining the nature of dark compact objects with spin-induced octupole moment measurement,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01309v2,"Pankaj Saini, N. V. Krishnendu","Various theoretical models predict the existence of exotic compact objects that can mimic the properties of black holes (BHs). Gravitational waves (GWs) from the mergers of compact objects have the potential to distinguish between exotic compact objects and BHs. The measurement of spin-induced multipole moments of compact objects in binaries provides a unique way to test the nature of compact objects. The observations of GWs by LIGO and Virgo have already put constraints on the spin-induced quadrupole moment, the leading order spin-induced moment. In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework to measure the spin-induced octupole moment, the next-to-leading order spin-induced moment. The precise measurement of the spin-induced octupole moment will allow us to test its consistency with that of Kerr BHs in general relativity and constrain the allowed parameter space for non-BH compact objects. For various simulated compact object binaries, we explore the ability of the LIGO and Virgo detector network to constrain the spin-induced octupole moment of compact objects. We find that LIGO and Virgo at design sensitivity can constrain the symmetric combination of component spin-induced octupole moments of binary for dimensionless spin magnitudes $\sim 0.8$. Further, we study the possibility of simultaneously measuring the spin-induced quadrupole and octupole moments. Finally, we perform this test on selected GW events reported in the third GW catalog.

Machine learning techniques have shown success in automating this process by detecting hidden patterns and deviations in large-scale data. The potential of quantum computing for machine learning has been widely recognized, leading to extensive research efforts to develop suitable quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. In particular, the search for QML algorithms for near-term NISQ devices is in full swing. However, NISQ devices pose additional challenges due to their limited qubit coherence times, low number of qubits, and high error rates. Kernel methods based on quantum kernel estimation have emerged as a promising approach to QML on NISQ devices, offering theoretical guarantees, versatility, and compatibility with NISQ constraints. Especially support vector machines (SVM) utilizing quantum kernel estimation have shown success in various supervised learning tasks. However, in the context of AD, semisupervised learning is of great relevance, and yet there is limited research published in this area. This paper introduces an approach to semisupervised AD based on the reconstruction loss of a support vector regression (SVR) with quantum kernel. This novel model is an alternative to the variational quantum and quantum kernel one-class classifiers, and is compared to a quantum autoencoder as quantum baseline and a SVR with radial-basis-function (RBF) kernel as well as a classical autoencoder as classical baselines. The models are benchmarked extensively on 10 real-world AD data sets and one toy data set, and it is shown that our SVR model with quantum kernel performs better than the SVR with RBF kernel as well as all other models, achieving highest mean AUC over all data sets. In addition, our QSVR outperforms the quantum autoencoder on 9 out of 11 data sets.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},08.2023,2023,08,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Hyperboloidal approach for static spherically symmetric spacetimes: a didactical introduction and applications in black-hole physics,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15735v2,Rodrigo Panosso Macedo,"This work offers a didactical introduction to the calculations and geometrical properties of a static, spherically symmetric spacetime foliated by hyperboloidal time surfaces. We discuss the various degrees of freedom involved, namely the height function, responsible for introducing the hyperboloidal time coordinate, and a radial compactification function. A central outcome is the expression of the Trautman-Bondi mass in terms of the hyperboloidal metric functions. Moreover, we apply this formalism to a class of wave equations commonly used in black-hole perturbation theory. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive derivation of the hyperboloidal minimal gauge, introducing two alternative approaches within this conceptual framework: the in-out and out-in strategies. Specifically, we demonstrate that the height function in the in-out strategy follows from the well-known tortoise coordinate by changing the sign of the terms that become singular at future null infinity. Similarly, for the out-in strategy, a sign change also occurs in the tortoise coordinate's regular terms. We apply the methodology to the following spacetimes: Singularity-approaching slices in Schwarzschild, higher-dimensional black holes, black hole with matter halo, and Reissner- Nordström-de Sitter. From this heuristic study, we conjecture that the out-in strategy is best adapted for black hole geometries that account for environmental or effective quantum effects.",{'black holes': 1},07.2023,2023,07,['Black Holes and GR']

First, we prove a generation theorem for quantum Markov semigroups on CV systems under the physical assumptions that (i) the generator has GKSL form with corresponding jump operators defined as polynomials of annihilation and creation operators; and (ii) the (possibly unbounded) generator increases all moments in a controlled manner.

Loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to quartic order action in ultra slow roll inflation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13636v2,"Suvashis Maity, H. V. Ragavendra, Shiv K. Sethi, L. Sriramkumar","[Abridged] In contemporary literature, the calculation of modifications to the inflationary scalar power spectrum due to the loops from the higher order interaction terms in the Hamiltonian have led to a discussion regarding the validity of perturbation theory. Recently, there have been efforts to examine the contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the loops arising from the cubic order terms in the action describing the perturbations, specifically in inflationary scenarios that permit an epoch of ultra slow roll (USR). A phase of USR inflation leads to significant observational consequences, such as the copious production of primordial black holes. In this work, we study the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum in a scenario of USR inflation arising due to the quartic order terms in the action describing the scalar perturbations. We compute the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the dominant term in the action at the quartic order. We consider a scenario wherein a phase of USR is sandwiched between two stages of slow roll inflation and analyze the behavior of the loop contributions in terms of the parameters involved. We examine the late, intermediate and early epochs of USR during inflation. In the inflationary scenario involving a late phase of USR, for reasonable choices of the parameters, we show that the loop corrections are negligible for the entire range of wave numbers. In the intermediate case, the contributions from the loops prove to be scale invariant over large scales, and we find that these contributions can amount to 30% of the leading order power spectrum. In the case wherein USR sets in early, we find that the loop contributions could be negative and can dominate the power spectrum at the leading order, which indicates a breakdown of the perturbative expansion. We conclude with a brief summary and outlook.",{'black holes': 1},07.2023,2023,07,['Black Holes and GR']

Maximal Information Leakage from Quantum Encoding of Classical Data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12529v2,Farhad Farokhi,"A new measure of information leakage for quantum encoding of classical data is defined.

The resulting measure of information leakage, referred to as maximal quantum leakage, is the multiplicative increase of the probability of correctly guessing any function of the classical data upon observing measurements of the quantum state. Maximal quantum leakage is shown to satisfy post-processing inequality (i.e., applying a quantum channel reduces information leakage) and independence property (i.e., leakage is zero if the quantum state is independent of the classical data), which are fundamental properties required for privacy and security analysis.

In this paper we construct a quantum regression algorithm wherein the quantum state directly encodes the classical data table and the variational parameters correspond directly to the regression coefficients which are real numbers by construction, providing a high degree of model interpretability and minimal cost to optimize with the right expressiveness. Instead of assuming the state preparation is given by granted, we discuss the state preparation with different encoders and their time complexity and overall resource cost.

Constraints on cosmologically coupled black holes from gravitational wave observations and minimal formation mass,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02474v2,"Luca Amendola, Davi C. Rodrigues, Sumit Kumar, Miguel Quartin","We test the possibility that the black holes (BHs) detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) may be cosmologically coupled and grow in mass proportionally to the cosmological scale factor to some power $k$, which may also act as the dark energy source if $k\approx 3$. This approach was proposed as an extension of Kerr BHs embedded in cosmological backgrounds and possibly without singularities or horizons. In our analysis, we develop and apply two methods to test these cosmologically coupled BHs (CCBHs) either with or without connection to dark energy. We consider different scenarios for the time between the binary BH formation and its merger, and we find that the standard log-uniform distribution yields weaker constraints than the CCBH-corrected case. Assuming that the minimum mass of a BH with stellar progenitor is $2M_\odot$, we estimate the probability that at least one BH among the observed ones had an initial mass below this threshold. We obtain these probabilities either directly from the observed data or by assuming the LVK power-law-plus-peak mass distribution. In the latter case we find, at $2σ$ level, that $k < 2.1$ for the standard log-uniform distribution, or $k < 1.1$ for the CCBH-corrected distribution. Slightly weaker bounds are obtained in the direct method. Considering the uncertainties on the nature of CCBHs, we also find that the required minimum CCBH mass value to eliminate the tensions for $k=3$ should be lower than 0.5 $M_\odot$ (again at 2$σ$). Finally, we show that future observations have the potential to decisively confirm these bounds.",{'black holes': 1},07.2023,2023,07,['Black Holes and GR']

In this study, combining the final-state projection model, the non-isometric model of black hole interior and Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, we investigate the information recovery from decoding Hawking radiation and demonstrate the emergence of the Page time in this setup. We incorporate the effective modes into the scrambling inside the horizon, which are usually disregarded in Hayden-Preskill protocols, and show that the Page time can be identified as the transition of information transmission channels from the EPR projection to the local projections. This offers a new perspective on the Page time. We compute the decoupling condition under which retrieving information is feasible and show that this model computes the black hole entropy consistent with the quantum extremal surface calculation. Assuming the full knowledge of the dynamics of the black hole interior, we show how Yoshida-Kitaev decoding strategy can be employed in the modified Hayden-Preskill protocol. Furthermore, we perform experimental tests of both probabilistic and Grover's search decoding strategies on the 7-qubit IBM quantum processors to validate our analytical findings and confirm the feasibility of retrieving information in the non-isometric model.

We show that the Ellis wormhole is analytically supported by a gravitational theory with a non-trivial coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term and we expand upon this notion by introducing higher derivative contributions of the scalar field. The extension of the gravitational theory does not yield any back-reacting component on the spacetime metric, which establishes the Ellis wormhole as a stealth solution in the generalized framework.

Though this integral model is not holographic, we do find that it has some holography-like features, especially the near-perfect size winding in high temperatures. Therefore, we would like to call it pseudo-holographic. We also find that the size winding of this model has a narrowly peaked size distribution, which is different from the ordinary SYK model. We apply the traversable wormhole teleportation protocol in the commuting SYK model and find that the teleportation has a few features similar to the semiclassical traversable wormhole but in different parameter regimes.

In particular, it can be applied to discern the features of quantum states, such as entanglement properties of a system, or in quantum machine learning algorithms. In this work, we tackle the problem of designing a very shallow quantum circuit, required in the quantum state diagonalization task, by utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). We use a novel encoding method for the RL-state, a dense reward function, and an $ε$-greedy policy to achieve this. We demonstrate that the circuits proposed by the reinforcement learning methods are shallower than the standard variational quantum state diagonalization algorithm and thus can be used in situations where hardware capabilities limit the depth of quantum circuits.

The BHL-BCL crossover: from nonlinear to linear quantum amplification,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05458v3,"Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Fernando Sols","The black-hole laser (BHL) effect is the self-amplification of Hawking radiation between a pair of horizons which act as a resonant cavity. In a flowing atomic condensate, the BHL effect arises in a finite supersonic region, where Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau (BCL) radiation is resonantly excited by any static perturbation. Thus, experimental attempts to produce a BHL unavoidably deal with the presence of a strong BCL background, making the observation of the BHL effect still a major challenge in the analogue gravity field. Here, we perform a theoretical study of the BHL-BCL crossover using an idealized model where both phenomena can be unambiguously isolated. By drawing an analogy with an unstable pendulum, we distinguish three main regimes according to the interplay between quantum fluctuations and classical stimulation: quantum BHL, classical BHL, and BCL. Based on quite general scaling arguments, the nonlinear amplification of quantum fluctuations up to saturation is identified as the most robust trait of a quantum BHL. A classical BHL behaves instead as a linear quantum amplifier, where the output is proportional to the input. The BCL regime also acts as a linear quantum amplifier, but its gain is exponentially smaller as compared to a classical BHL. Complementary signatures of black-hole lasing are a decrease in the amplification for increasing BCL amplitude or a nonmonotonic dependence of the growth rate with respect to the background parameters. We also identify interesting analogue phenomena such as Hawking-stimulated white-hole radiation or quantum BCL-stimulated Hawking radiation. The results of this work not only are of interest for analogue gravity, where they help to distinguish each phenomenon and to design experimental schemes for a clear observation of the BHL effect, but they also open the prospect of finding applications of analogue concepts in quantum technologies.",{'hawking radiation': 2},06.2023,2023,06,['Black Holes and GR']

We study the dynamics of this system, simultaneously describing the evolving spacetime and magnetized plasma, and present the first relativistic calculation simulating two equal-mass, non-spinning black holes as they inspiral from a $20M$ ($G=c=1$) initial separation almost to merger, $\simeq 9M$ ($M$=binary mass). Our dynamical results imply important observational consequences: for instance, the accretion rate $\dot M$ onto the black holes first decreases and then reaches a plateau, dropping by only a factor of $\sim 3$ despite the rapid inspiral. An estimated bolometric light curve thus suggests some merging SMBBHs may be quite luminous past the predicted decoupling from the circumbinary disk. The minidisks through which the accretion reaches the black holes are very non-standard: Reynolds, not Maxwell, stresses dominate, and they oscillate between two states. In one part of the cycle, ``sloshing"" streams transfer mass from one minidisk to the other through the L1 point at a rate $\sim 0.1\times$ the accretion rate, carrying kinetic energy at a rate that can be as large as the peak minidisk bolometric luminosity. We also discover that episodic accretion drives minidisks with time-varying tilts. The unsigned poloidal magnetic flux on the black hole event horizon is roughly constant at a dimensionless level $φ\sim 2-3$, but doubles just before merger; if the black holes had significant spin, this flux indicates the potential for powerful jets with variability driven by binary dynamics, another prediction of potentially unique EM signatures.

Among state-of-the-art methods, Markov Random Fields (MRF) can be used to model dependencies between pixels, and achieve a segmentation by minimizing an associated cost function. Currently, finding the optimal set of segments for a given image modeled as a MRF appears to be NP-hard. In this paper, we aim to take advantage of the exponential scalability of quantum computing to speed up the segmentation of Synthetic Aperture Radar images. For that purpose, we propose an hybrid quantum annealing classical optimization Expectation Maximization algorithm to obtain optimal sets of segments. After proposing suitable formulations, we discuss the performances and the scalability of our approach on the D-Wave quantum computer. We also propose a short study of optimal computation parameters to enlighten the limits and potential of the adiabatic quantum computation to solve large instances of combinatorial optimization problems.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2023,2023,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In our previous work, we have considered quantum loop corrections to the curvature perturbation and found that the growth of these small-scale modes would affect the curvature perturbation at large scales probed by cosmic microwave background observation. In this work, we will further derive the constraints on the growing modes in the transition between the slow-roll and the ultra-slow-roll phases under the effect of the loop corrections.

Models consider different seeding and accretion scenarios, which require the detection and characterisation of black holes in the first few hundred million years after Big Bang to be validated. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z=10.6, revealing the detection of the [NeIV]2423 and CII*1335 transitions (typical of Active Galactic Nuclei, AGN), as well as semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than 10^9 cm-3, typical of the Broad Line Region of AGN. These spectral features indicate that GN-z11 hosts an accreting black hole. The spectrum also reveals a deep and blueshifted CIV1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with velocity 800-1000 km/s, likely driven by the AGN. Assuming local virial relations, we derive a black hole mass of log(M_BH/Msun) = 6.2 +- 0.3, accreting at about 5 times the Eddington rate. These properties are consistent with both heavy seeds scenarios, or scenarios envisaging intermediate/light seeds experiencing episodic super-Eddington phases. Our finding naturally explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance.",{'black holes': 2},05.2023,2023,05,['Black Holes and GR']
A Possible Quantum Gravity Hint in Binary Black Hole Merger,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09391v5,Parthasarathi Majumdar,"We present a semi-rigorous justification of Bekenstein's Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics applicable to a universe with black holes present, based on a generic quantum gravity formulation of a black hole spacetime, where the bulk Hamiltonian constraint plays a central role. Specializing to Loop Quantum Gravity, and considering the inspiral and post-ringdown stages of binary black hole merger into a remnant black hole, we show that the Generalized Second Law implies a lower bound on the non-perturbative LQG correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black hole entropy. This lower bound itself is expressed as a function of the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula for entropy. Results of the analyses of LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data recently performed to verify the Hawking Area Theorem for binary black hole merger, are shown to be entirely consistent with this Loop Quantum Gravity-induced inequality. However, the consistency is independent of the magnitude of the Loop Quantum Gravity corrections to black hole entropy, depending only on the negative algebraic sign of the quantum correction. We argue that results of alternative quantum gravity computations of quantum black hole entropy, where the quantum entropy exceeds the Bekenstein-Hawking value, may not share this consistency.",{'black holes': 1},05.2023,2023,05,['Black Holes and GR']

First, we show that any asymptotically flat static $(M^{n},g)$ which achieves the equality and has CMC or equipotential boundary is isometric to a rotationally symmetric region of the Schwarzschild manifold. Then, we apply conformal techniques to derive a new Minkowski-type inequality for the level sets of bounded static potentials. Taken together, these provide a robust approach to detecting rotational symmetry of asymptotically flat static systems.
  As an application, we prove global uniqueness of static metric extensions for the Bartnik data induced by both Schwarzschild coordinate spheres and Euclidean coordinate spheres in dimension $n < 8$ under the natural condition of Schwarzschild stability. This generalizes an earlier result of Miao. We also establish uniqueness for equipotential photon surfaces with small Einstein-Hilbert energy.

Using a wide-jet reconstruction for the candidate jet, the $γ$+jet invariant mass spectrum measured in data is examined for the presence of resonances over the standard model continuum background. The background is estimated by fitting the mass distribution with a functional form. The data exhibit no statistically significant deviations from the expected standard model background.

Smith, Gokul Subramanian Ravi, Charles Yuan, Frederic T. Chong, Benjamin J. Brown","Fabrication errors pose a significant challenge in scaling up solid-state quantum devices to the sizes required for fault-tolerant (FT) quantum applications. To mitigate the resource overhead caused by fabrication errors, we combine two approaches: (1) leveraging the flexibility of a modular architecture, (2) adapting the procedure of quantum error correction (QEC) to account for fabrication defects. We simulate the surface code adapted to qubit arrays with arbitrarily distributed defects to find metrics that characterize how defects affect fidelity. We then determine the impact of defects on the resource overhead of realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer, on a chiplet-based modular architecture. Our strategy for dealing with fabrication defects demonstrates an exponential suppression of logical failure where error rates of non-faulty physical qubits are ~0.1% in a circuit-based noise model. This is a typical regime where we imagine running the defect-free surface code. We use our numerical results to establish post-selection criteria for building a device from defective chiplets. Using our criteria, we then evaluate the resource overhead in terms of the average number of fabricated physical qubits per logical qubit. We find that an optimal choice of chiplet size, based on the defect rate and target fidelity, is essential to limiting any additional error correction overhead due to defects. When the optimal chiplet size is chosen, at a defect rate of 1% the resource overhead can be reduced to below 3X and 6X respectively for the two defect models we use, for a wide range of target performance. We also determine cutoff fidelity values that help identify whether a qubit should be disabled or kept as part of the error correction code.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2023,2023,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Whenever our perspective applies, we obtain a boundary signature for these interior collisions which is stated in terms of the mutual information.

We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling to the CCF along with the autocorrelation function of the CMASS galaxies.

Hydrodynamical Evolution of Black-Hole Binaries Embedded in AGN Discs: III.

To understand their orbital evolution through interactions with the disc gas, we perform a suite of 2D high-resolution, local shearing box, viscous hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass binaries. We find that viscosity not only smooths the flow structure around prograde circular binaries, but also greatly raises their accretion rates. The torque associated with accretion may be overwhelmingly positive and dominate over the gravitational torque at a high accretion rate. However, the accreted angular momentum per unit mass decreases with increasing viscosity, making it easier to shrink the binary orbit. In addition, retrograde binaries still experience rapid orbital decay, and prograde eccentric binaries still experience eccentricity damping. Our numerical experiments further show that prograde binaries are more likely to be hardened if the physical sizes of the accretors are sufficiently small such that the accretion rate is reduced. The dependency of the binary accretion rate on the accretor size can be weaken through boosted accretion either due to a high viscosity or a more isothermal-like equation of state (EOS). Our results widen the explored parameter space for the hydrodynamics of embedded BBHs and demonstrate that their orbital evolution in AGN discs is a complex, multifaceted problem.",{'black holes': 1},03.2023,2023,03,['Black Holes and GR']

We analyse these equations for both quantum and classical spin systems, recovering known results and providing novel analytical solutions for a range of more complex cases.

Hamiltonian variational ansatz without barren plateaus,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08529v2,"Chae-Yeun Park, Nathan Killoran","Variational quantum algorithms, which combine highly expressive parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) and optimization techniques in machine learning, are one of the most promising applications of a near-term quantum computer. Despite their huge potential, the utility of variational quantum algorithms beyond tens of qubits is still questioned. One of the central problems is the trainability of PQCs. The cost function landscape of a randomly initialized PQC is often too flat, asking for an exponential amount of quantum resources to find a solution. This problem, dubbed barren plateaus, has gained lots of attention recently, but a general solution is still not available. In this paper, we solve this problem for the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA), which is widely studied for solving quantum many-body problems. After showing that a circuit described by a time-evolution operator generated by a local Hamiltonian does not have exponentially small gradients, we derive parameter conditions for which the HVA is well approximated by such an operator. Based on this result, we propose an initialization scheme for the variational quantum algorithms and a parameter-constrained ansatz free from barren plateaus.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2023,2023,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Disc corona radii and QPO frequencies in black hole binaries: testing Lense-Thirring precession origin,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08314v4,"Aya Kubota, Chris Done, Kazuki Tsurumi, Ryuki Mizukawa","Stellar-mass black hole binary systems in the luminous X-ray states show a strong quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in their Comptonised emission. The frequency of this feature correlates with the ratio of a disc to Comptonised emission rather than with total luminosity. Hence it changes dramatically during spectral transitions between the hard and soft states. Its amplitude is also strongest in these intermediate states, making them an important test of QPO models. However, these have complex spectra which generally require a disc and two separate Comptonisation components, making it difficult to uniquely derive the spectral parameters. We build a new energy-conserving model of the accretion flow, SSsed model, which assumes a fixed radial emissivity but with a changing emission mechanism. This is similar to the agnsed model in xspec but tuned to be more suitable for stellar mass black holes. It uses a combination of the disc luminosity and temperature to constrain the inner radius of the (colour temperature corrected) blackbody disc, separating this from the more complex Comptonisation spectra emitted inwards of this radius. We show a pilot study of this model fit to hundreds of RXTE spectra of the black hole binary XTE J1550-564. We show that the derived disc radius tightly anti-correlates with the central frequencies of the low-frequency QPO detected in the same observations. The relation is consistent with the quantitative predictions of Lense-Thirring precession of the entire inner Comptonisation regions for the assumed system parameters. This supports the scenario that low-frequency QPOs are caused by Lense-Thirring precession.",{'black holes': 1},02.2023,2023,02,['Black Holes and GR']

We employ a masked autoregressive normalizing flow model which can be conveniently trained to quickly reproduce the target probability distribution and sample templates from it. Thanks to the normalizing flow, our code takes a few {\it hours} to produce random template banks with millions of templates, making it particularly suitable for high-dimensional spaces, such as those associated to precession, eccentricity and/or HM. After validating the performance of our method, we generate a bank for precessing black holes and a bank for aligned-spin binaries with HMs: with only 5% of the injections with fitting factor below the target of 0.97, we show that both banks cover satisfactorily the space.

The novel feature of these generalized wavefunctional ERG schemes is allowing for modifications of the dispersion relation, which drastically changes the entanglement structure of the ultraviolet states. Through our construction, we demonstrate that cMERA can be derived from a more fundamental ""microscopic"" principle, which amounts to the usual RG principle of path integral independence, suitably adapted to quantum states of the field theory.

Primordial black hole mass functions as a probe of cosmic origin,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09403v3,"Yi-Fu Cai, Chengfeng Tang, Geyu Mo, Sheng-Feng Yan, Chao Chen, Xiao-Han Ma, Bo Wang, Wentao Luo, Damien Easson, Antonino Marciano","We discuss a novel window to probe the origin of our universe via the mass functions of primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass functions of PBHs are simply estimated using the conventional Press-Schechter formalism for two paradigms of cosmic origin, including inflationary $Λ$CDM and bounce cosmology. The standard inflationary $Λ$CDM model cannot generate an appreciable number of massive PBHs; however, non-trivial inflation models with blue-tilted power spectra at small scales and matter bounce cosmology provide formation mechanisms for heavy PBHs, which in turn, may seed the observed supermassive black holes (SMBHs). By fitting the SMBH mass functions at high redshift ($z \sim 6$) derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS) quasars, for two paradigms of cosmic origin, we derive constraints on the PBH density fraction $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ at $z \sim 6$ and the characteristic mass $M_{\star}$, with the prior assumption that all SMBHs stem from PBHs. We demonstrate that this newly proposed procedure, relying on astronomical measurements that utilize deep-field surveys of SMBHs at high redshift, can be used to constrain models of cosmic origin. Additionally, although not the main focus of this paper, we evolve the mass function from $z\sim6$ to $z\sim0$ through an assumption of $3\times 10^8$-year Eddington's accretion, and give a rough estimation of $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ at $z \sim 0$.",{'black holes': 2},01.2023,2023,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Differently from other models, energy conservation and the thermal nature of the Hawking radiation are taken into account. We show that the QES formula follows for the entropy of multiple subsets of the radiation and black hole. We further show that a version of entanglement wedge reconstruction can be proved by computing suitable trace norms and quantum fidelities involving the action of a unitary on a subset of Hawking partners. If the Hawking partner is in an island, its unitary can be reconstructed by a unitary on the radiation.

Solving various NP-Hard problems using exponentially fewer qubits on a Quantum Computer,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06978v2,"Yagnik Chatterjee, Eric Bourreau, Marko J.

Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to address such combinatorial problems have been of great interest in the past few years. Such algorithms are heuristic in nature and aim to obtain an approximate solution. Significant improvements in computational time and/or the ability to treat large problems are some of the principal promises of quantum computing in this regard. The hardware, however, is still in its infancy and the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are not able to optimize industrially relevant problems. Moreover, the storage of qubits and introduction of entanglement require extreme physical conditions. An issue with quantum optimization algorithms such as QAOA is that they scale linearly with problem size. In this paper, we build upon a proprietary methodology which scales logarithmically with problem size - opening an avenue for treating optimization problems of unprecedented scale on gate-based quantum computers. In order to test the performance of the algorithm, we first find a way to apply it to a handful of NP-hard problems: Maximum Cut, Minimum Partition, Maximum Clique, Maximum Weighted Independent Set. Subsequently, these algorithms are tested on a quantum simulator with graph sizes of over a hundred nodes and on a real quantum computer up to graph sizes of 256.

Newtonian gravity provides an excellent pedagogical tool to understand the basic features of gravitational wave observations, but it must be augmented with the assumption of gravitational radiation from General Relativity for accelerating masses as there is no gravitational wave in Newtonian gravity. The simplest approach would be to consider a binary system of two non-spinning masses (two black holes) circling their common center of mass. All the computations can be done within Newtonian physics, but the General Relativistic formula for the power carried by gravitational waves is required in this scheme. It turns out there is a subtle point: for the consistency of this simple, yet pedagogical computation, taking the lowest order power formula from General Relativity leads to complex individual masses.

Non-local finite-depth circuits for constructing SPT states and quantum cellular automata,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06844v4,"David T. Stephen, Arpit Dua, Ali Lavasani, Rahul Nandkishore","Whether a given target state can be prepared by starting with a simple product state and acting with a finite-depth quantum circuit is a key question in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. It underpins classifications of topological phases, as well as the understanding of topological quantum codes, and has obvious relevance for device implementations. Traditionally, this question assumes that the quantum circuit is made up of unitary gates that are geometrically local. Inspired by the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we reconsider this question with $k$-local gates, i.e. gates that act on no more than $k$ degrees of freedom, but are not restricted to be geometrically local. First, we construct explicit finite-depth circuits of symmetric $k$-local gates which create symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states from an initial a product state. Our construction applies both to SPT states protected by global symmetries and subsystem symmetries, but not to those with higher-form symmetries, which we conjecture remain nontrivial. Next, we show how to implement arbitrary translationally invariant quantum cellular automata (QCA) in any dimension using finite-depth circuits of $k$-local gates. These results imply that the topological classifications of SPT phases and QCA both collapse to a single trivial phase in the presence of $k$-local interactions. We furthermore argue that SPT phases are fragile to generic $k$-local symmetric perturbations. We conclude by discussing the implications for other phases, such as fracton phases, and surveying future directions. Our analysis opens a new experimentally motivated conceptual direction examining the stability of phases and the feasibility of state preparation without the assumption of geometric locality.",{'quantum circuit': 2},12.2022,2022,12,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Thus, the no-hair theorem that assumes the outside medium is a vacuum, is not applicable in this case. Bearing this in mind and considering a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$ immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$, we show that all three frequencies related to the equatorial circular orbit of a test particle become imaginary for the orbits of radii $r_B > 2B^{-1}$. It signifies that if a BH is surrounded by a magnetic field of order $B \sim R_g^{-1}$ (where $R_g$ is the gravitational radius of the BH), a test particle could unable to continue its regular geodesic motion from/at $r > r_B$, hence the accretion disk could not be formed, and the motion of other stellar objects around the BH could be absent. As the BHs are generally detected by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas, a magnetic field of order $B \sim R_g^{-1}$ could be able to shield a BH in such a way that it could remain undetectable. Motivated with this theoretical investigation and considering the sphere (of radius $r_f$) of magnetic influence around an astrophysical BH, we constrain $B$, above which a magnetized BH could remain undetectable. For example, $M=10^9M_{\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^6$ G and $M=10M_{\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^{14}$ G could remain undetectable for $r_f \sim 10^5R_g$.

We study in detail the cooling processes necessary for successful stellar collapse in the dark sector and show that for suitable choices of the particle masses, we indeed predict populating the mass gap with dark sector black holes. In particular, we numerically find that the heavier of the two dark sector massive particles cannot be lighter than, approximately, the visible sector proton for the resulting dark sector black holes to have masses within the mass gap. We discuss constraints on this scenario and how to test it with future, larger black hole merger statistics.",{'black holes': 5},08.2022,2022,08,['Black Holes and GR']

Breakdown of quantum mechanics in gravitational holography,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01019v2,Abram Akal,"According to the holographic principle, the information content assigned to a gravitational region is processed by its lower dimensional boundary. As an example setup compatible with this principle, the AdS/CFT correspondence relies on the existence of D-branes in superstring theory. Black hole complementarity is inevitably linked to holography and states that information associated with the collapsed pure state is reflected in the near horizon region. Yet, if this is so, it is indispensable to understand the mechanism that makes black holes viewed from the outside evolve unitarily. We here argue that the information preserving quantum atmosphere of the black hole emerges from hidden variables on its horizon which would necessitate going beyond a probabilistic description within standard quantum theory. In AdS/CFT, this would mean that the completion of the semiclassical subalgebra to the complete boundary algebra has to be traced back to the emergent near horizon Hilbert space structure. The present investigations suggest that spacetime horizons, in general, may play a crucial role in restoring a long speculated ontology in quantum mechanics.","{'AdS/CFT': 2, 'black holes': 1, 'holography': 1}",08.2022,2022,08,"['Holography', 'Black Holes and GR']"

We prove that this belief is overly conservative by constructing a constant quantum-depth circuit for the task, inspired by the method of Shor error correction. Furthermore, our circuit demands only local gates in a two dimensional circuit -- we show how to implement it in a highly parallelized way on an architecture similar to that of Google's Sycamore processor. With these features, our algorithm brings the central task of multivariate trace estimation closer to the capabilities of near-term quantum processors.

Cone-Restricted Information Theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04300v2,"Ian George, Eric Chitambar","The max-relative entropy and the conditional min-entropy it induces have become central to one-shot information theory. Both may be expressed in terms of a conic program over the positive semidefinite cone. Recently, it was shown that the same conic program altered to be over the separable cone admits an operational interpretation in terms of communicating classical information over a quantum channel. In this work, we generalize this framework of replacing the cone to determine which results in quantum information theory rely upon the positive semidefinite cone and which can be generalized. We show the fully quantum Stein's lemma and asymptotic equipartition property break down if the cone exponentially increases in resourcefulness but never approximates the positive semidefinite cone. However, we show for CQ states, the separable cone is sufficient to recover the asymptotic theory, thereby drawing a strong distinction between the fully and partial quantum settings. We present parallel results for the extended conditional min-entropy. In doing so, we extend the notion of k-superpositive channels to superchannels. We also present operational uses of this framework. We first show the cone restricted min-entropy of a Choi operator captures a measure of entanglement-assisted noiseless classical communication using restricted measurements. We show that quantum majorization results naturally generalize to other cones. As a novel example, we introduce a new min-entropy-like quantity that captures the quantum majorization of quantum channels in terms of bistochastic pre-processing. Lastly, we relate this framework to general conic norms and their non-additivity. Throughout this work we emphasize the introduced measures' relationship to general convex resource theories. In particular, we look at both resource theories that capture locality and resource theories of coherence/Abelian symmetries.",{'quantum information theory': 1},06.2022,2022,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
From Non-Markovian Dissipation to Spatiotemporal Control of Quantum Nanodevices,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11247v5,"Thibaut Lacroix, Brendon W. Lovett, Alex W. Chin","Nanodevices exploiting quantum effects are critically important elements of future quantum technologies (QT), but their real-world performance is strongly limited by decoherence arising from local `environmental' interactions. Compounding this, as devices become more complex, i.e. contain multiple functional units, the `local' environments begin to overlap, creating the possibility of environmentally mediated decoherence phenomena on new time-and-length scales. Such complex and inherently non-Markovian dynamics could present a challenge for scaling up QT, but -- on the other hand -- the ability of environments to transfer `signals' and energy might also enable sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination of inter-component processes, as is suggested to happen in biological nanomachines, like enzymes and photosynthetic proteins. Exploiting numerically exact many body methods (tensor networks) we study a fully quantum model that allows us to explore how propagating environmental dynamics can instigate and direct the evolution of spatially remote, non-interacting quantum systems. We demonstrate how energy dissipated into the environment can be remotely harvested to create transient excited/reactive states, and also identify how reorganisation triggered by system excitation can qualitatively and reversibly alter the `downstream' kinetics of a `functional' quantum system. With access to complete system-environment wave functions, we elucidate the microscopic processes underlying these phenomena, providing new insight into how they could be exploited for energy efficient quantum devices.",{'tensor networks': 1},05.2022,2022,05,['Tensor Networks']

Explore the Origin of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking from Adaptive Perturbation Method,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00414v4,"Chen-Te Ma, Yiwen Pan, Hui Zhang","Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the underlying laws of a physical system are symmetric, but the vacuum state chosen by the system is not. The (3+1)d $φ^4$ theory is relatively simple compared to other more complex theories, making it a good starting point for investigating the origin of non-trivial vacua. The adaptive perturbation method is a technique used to handle strongly coupled systems. The study of strongly correlated systems is useful in testing holography. It has been successful in strongly coupled QM and is being generalized to scalar field theory to analyze the system in the strong-coupling regime. The unperturbed Hamiltonian does not commute with the usual number operator. However, the quantized scalar field admits a plane-wave expansion when acting on the vacuum. While quantizing the scalar field theory, the field can be expanded into plane-wave modes, making the calculations more tractable. However, the Lorentz symmetry, which describes how physical laws remain the same under certain spacetime transformations, might not be manifest in this approach. The proposed elegant resummation of Feynman diagrams aims to restore the Lorentz symmetry in the calculations. The results obtained using this method are compared with numerical solutions for specific values of the coupling constant $λ= 1, 2, 4, 8, 16$. Finally, we find evidence for quantum triviality, where self-consistency of the theory in the UV requires $λ= 0$. This result implies that the $φ^4$ theory alone does not experience SSB, and the $\langle φ\rangle = 0$ phase is protected under the RG-flow by a boundary of Gaussian fixed-points.",{'holography': 1},05.2022,2022,05,['Holography']

Specifically, we consider the simplest case of a d=1+1 massless Dirac fermion, for which the Hawking effect can be understood in terms of a quench of the uniform vacuum state with a non-uniform Hamiltonian that interfaces modes with opposite chirality. For both our models we find that additional modes arising from the lattice discretization play a crucial role, as they provide the bulk reservoir for the Hawking radiation: the Hawking pairs emerge from fermions deep inside the Fermi sea scattering off the effective black hole horizon. Our first model combines local hopping dynamics with a translation over one lattice site, and we find the resulting Floquet dynamics to realize a causal horizon, with fermions scattering from the region outside the horizon. For our second model, which relies on a purely local hopping Hamiltonian, we find the fermions to scatter from the inside.

Based on the existence of the Hawking radiation for the static observers standing outside a Schwarzschild black hole, we show a direct contradiction between the postulates (2) and (4).

It has been shown that this approach offers a provable exponential speedup compared to any known classical algorithm for certain data sets. The training of such models corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem either via its primal or dual formulation. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the training algorithms are affected by statistical uncertainty, which has a major impact on their complexity. We show that the dual problem can be solved in $O(M^{4.67}/\varepsilon^2)$ quantum circuit evaluations, where $M$ denotes the size of the data set and $\varepsilon$ the solution accuracy compared to the ideal result from exact expectation values, which is only obtainable in theory. We prove under an empirically motivated assumption that the kernelized primal problem can alternatively be solved in $O(\min \{ M^2/\varepsilon^6, \, 1/\varepsilon^{10} \})$ evaluations by employing a generalization of a known classical algorithm called Pegasos.

In this paper we investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result by Chia, Gilyén, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (STOC 2020) showed that the QSVT can be efficiently ""dequantized"" for low-rank matrices, and discussed its implication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by establishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and making progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class of matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices.
  We first show how to efficiently ""dequantize"", with arbitrarily small constant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply this technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant precision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a central computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when given, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state) can be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a complementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same problem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the superiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that said superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum setting.

One of the main open problems is the lack of ergodicity, or mode collapse, for typical stochastic solvers based on Monte Carlo techniques leading to poor generalization or lack of robustness to uncertainties. Currently, there is no universal metric to quantify such performance deficiencies across various solvers. Here, we introduce a new diversity measure for quantifying the number of independent approximate solutions for NP-hard optimization problems. Among others, it allows benchmarking solver performance by a required time-to-diversity (TTD), a generalization of often used time-to-solution (TTS). We illustrate this metric by comparing the sampling power of various quantum annealing strategies. In particular, we show that the inhomogeneous quantum annealing schedules can redistribute and suppress the emergence of topological defects by controlling space-time separated critical fronts, leading to an advantage over standard quantum annealing schedules with respect to both TTS and TTD for finding rare solutions. Using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations for up to 1600 qubits, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium driving of quantum fluctuations, guided by efficient approximate tensor network contractions, can significantly reduce the fraction of hard instances for random frustrated 2D spin-glasses with local fields. Specifically, we observe that by creating a class of algorithmic quantum phase transitions, the diversity of solutions can be enhanced by up to 40% with the fraction of hard-to-sample instances reducing by more than 25%.",{'tensor network': 1},10.2021,2021,10,['Tensor Networks']

The fidelity of teleporting a quantum state from an input qubit to an infinitely distant output qubit shows the same critical onset. Specifically, these finite-time transitions occur in short-range interacting two-dimensional random unitary circuits and in sufficiently long-range interacting one-dimensional circuits. The phase transition is understood by mapping the random continuous-time evolution to a finite-temperature thermal state of an effective spin Hamiltonian, where the inverse temperature equals the evolution time in the circuit. In this framework, the entanglement between two distant qubits at times $t>t_c$ corresponds to the emergence of long-range ferromagnetic spin correlations below the critical temperature.

Specifically, we demonstrate that the size of the entropy sphere associated with the underlying microstructure has to be necessarily broadened when the fine grained radiation entropy becomes maximal. Such an enlargement is understood to be the consequence of unitarization effects in quantum gravity and aligns with recent findings in holography arguing that purification happens via semiclassically invisible quantum correlations extending across the black hole atmosphere.

A parallel quantum algorithm is proposed for simulating the dynamics of a large class of Hamiltonians with good sparse structures, called uniform-structured Hamiltonians, including various Hamiltonians of practical interest like local Hamiltonians and Pauli sums. Given the oracle access to the target sparse Hamiltonian, in both query and gate complexity, the running time of our parallel quantum simulation algorithm measured by the quantum circuit depth has a doubly (poly-)logarithmic dependence $\operatorname{polylog}\log(1/ε)$ on the simulation precision $ε$. This presents an exponential improvement over the dependence $\operatorname{polylog}(1/ε)$ of previous optimal sparse Hamiltonian simulation algorithm without parallelism. To obtain this result, we introduce a novel notion of parallel quantum walk, based on Childs' quantum walk. The target evolution unitary is approximated by a truncated Taylor series, which is obtained by combining these quantum walks in a parallel way. A lower bound $Ω(\log \log (1/ε))$ is established, showing that the $ε$-dependence of the gate depth achieved in this work cannot be significantly improved.
  Our algorithm is applied to simulating three physical models: the Heisenberg model, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and a quantum chemistry model in second quantization.

Here, we present a digital quantum algorithm to solve Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer by mapping it to the Schrödinger equation. The non-Hermitian nature of the resulting Hamiltonian is solved by embedding its propagator into an enlarged Hilbert space by using only one additional ancillary qubit. Moreover, due to the choice of periodic boundary conditions, given by the definition of the discretized momentum operator, we duplicate the initial condition, which substantially improves the stability and performance of the protocol. The algorithm shows a feasible approach for using efficient Hamiltonian simulation techniques as Quantum Signal Processing to solve the price dynamics of financial derivatives on a digital quantum computer. Our approach differs from those based on Monte Carlo integration, exclusively focused on sampling the solution assuming the dynamics is known. We report expected accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using 9 qubits to simulate its dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and an expected success probability of the post-selection procedure due to the embedding protocol above 60%.",{'quantum computer': 3},01.2021,2021,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Quantum simulation of gauge theory via orbifold lattice,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06576v3,"Alexander J. Buser, Hrant Gharibyan, Masanori Hanada, Masazumi Honda, Junyu Liu","We propose a new framework for simulating $\text{U}(k)$ Yang-Mills theory on a universal quantum computer. This construction uses the orbifold lattice formulation proposed by Kaplan, Katz, and Unsal, who originally applied it to supersymmetric gauge theories. Our proposed approach yields a novel perspective on quantum simulation of quantum field theories, carrying certain advantages over the usual Kogut-Susskind formulation. We discuss the application of our constructions to computing static properties and real-time dynamics of Yang-Mills theories, from glueball measurements to AdS/CFT, making use of a variety of quantum information techniques including qubitization, quantum signal processing, Jordan-Lee-Preskill bounds, and shadow tomography. The generalizations to certain supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories appear to be straightforward, providing a path towards the quantum simulation of quantum gravity via holographic duality.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'holographic duality': 1, 'quantum computer': 1}",11.2020,2020,11,"['Holography', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"
"Universality, intertwiners and black hole information",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12565v2,Abram Akal,"The central question in this article is how information does leak out from black holes. Relying on algebraic arguments and the concept of superselection sectors, we propose the existence of certain operators whose correlations extend across the black hole atmosphere and range into the interior. Contained in the full algebra, these black hole intertwiners will not belong to the subalgebra describing semiclassical bulk physics. We study this proposal in the context of operator reconstructions for code spaces containing a large number of microstates. As long as the atmosphere is excluded from a particular subsystem, the global state seen under the action of the associated algebra is maximally mixed and therefore described by a single classical background. Once the relevant correlations are encoded, i.e. if the algebra is sufficiently enlarged, perfect state distinguishability becomes possible. We arrive at this by computing the von Neumann entropy which may explain the result obtained by applying the quantum extremal surface prescription to the mixed state. We then examine these insights in the context of black hole evaporation and argue that information is transferred to the radiation via black hole intertwiners. We derive the Page curve. The mechanism above suggests that black hole information is topologically protected. An infalling observer would experience no drama. This may resolve the unitarity problem without running into any firewall or state puzzle, the latter being evident in generalized entropy computations. We also examine the question of how certain wormhole topologies may be understood given these findings. We argue that their occurrence in gravity replica computations may be related to the maximal correlation between radiation and atmosphere surrounding the old black hole. This may suggest a connection between topology change and near horizon quantum gravitational effects.",{'black holes': 1},10.2020,2020,10,['Black Holes and GR']
Optimal tail exponents in general last passage percolation via bootstrapping &amp; geodesic geometry,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03594v2,"Shirshendu Ganguly, Milind Hegde","We consider last passage percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ with general weight distributions, which is expected to be a member of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this model, an oriented path between given endpoints which maximizes the sum of the i.i.d. weight variables associated to its vertices is called a geodesic. Under natural conditions of curvature of the limiting geodesic weight profile and stretched exponential decay of both tails of the point-to-point weight, we use geometric arguments to upgrade the assumptions to prove optimal upper and lower tail behavior with the exponents of $3/2$ and $3$ for the weight of the geodesic from $(1,1)$ to $(r,r)$ for all large finite $r$. The proofs merge several ideas, including the well known super-additivity property of last passage values, concentration of measure behavior for sums of stretched exponential random variables, and geometric insights coming from the study of geodesics and more general objects called geodesic watermelons. Previously such optimal behavior was only known for exactly solvable models, with proofs relying on hard analysis of formulas from integrable probability, which are unavailable in the general setting. Our results illustrate a facet of universality in a class of KPZ stochastic growth models and provide a geometric explanation of the upper and lower tail exponents of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution, the conjectured one point scaling limit of such models. The key arguments are based on an observation of general interest that super-additivity allows a natural iterative bootstrapping procedure to obtain improved tail estimates.",{'geodesics': 1},07.2020,2020,07,['Black Holes and GR']
