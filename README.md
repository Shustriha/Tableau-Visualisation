# Tableau Visualisation

## About:
 This work was in continuation of Python-Scrapper project. Information about physics publications  
obtained from that project was visualised in Tableau in order to gain better understanding of overall   
trends in the field.

## Data Set:
 See detailed explanation of Data Set structure in separate Data_Set.md file.
Uptaded versions of datasets appear from time to time on kaggle.com and can be found under the title:  
"Physics Articles from arxiv.org"


## Summary: 

  The goal of this work was to understand recent trends in the  chosen topics.  
Data for visualisation was gathered by Python Scraping code from arxiv.org. Specific versions of csv  
files used for visualisation ara provided. Overall nubmer of articles used in the analysis is ~ 1000.

  

## Conclusion: 

 Among the intriguing findings was the connection between tensor networks and quantum computers.   
 Given that my masterâ€™s thesis is titled "Tensor Networks as Probes of Near Horizon Geometry,"   
 you can imagine my excitement about discovering that tensor networks are a hot topic worldwide!
