## About

  The goal of the current work was to understand what are the latest trends in research in the intersection of the following topics: 
 1.  Tensor Networks
 2.  Holography (aka AdS/CFT)
 3.  Black Holes and GR (General Relativity)
 4.  Quantum Computers and Quantum Information

    

  Each topic is assigned to an article based on precence of specific key words:
  
   1. Tensor Networks: tensor network, tensor networks, MERA, random tensor network, RTN, cMERA,
      hyperbolic lattices, continuous tensor network, tensor networks in machine learning, stabilizer state

   2. Holography: AdS/CFT, BTZ black hole, BTZ black holes, RT formula, bulk geometry, holographic code, holographic duality,
      quantum error-correcting code, holographic entanglement, holographic shadow, holography, Renyi entropy, bit thread,
      quantum bit threads, emergent space-time geometry, geometry of entangled states

   3. Black_Holes_and_GR: hawking radiation, geodesics, einstein equations, traversible wormhole, traversible wormholes,
      black holes

   4. Quantum_Computers_and_Quantum_Information: entanglement of assistance, entanglement of purification, entanglement renormalization,
      quantum circuit, quantum computer, quantum error-correcting code, quantum information theory, quantum machine learning, tensor
      networks in machine learning, random quantum circuits
